		FOREWORD
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	The preservation of animal and plant life, and of the general
	beauty of Nature, is one of the foremost duties of the men and
	women of to-day. It is an imperative duty, because it must be
	performed at once, for otherwise it will be too late. Every
	possible means of preservation,&mdash;sentimental, educational
	and legislative,&mdash;must be employed.
</p>
<p>
The present warning issues with no uncertain sound, because this
great battle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by
gentle tones, nor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who
have no sense of beauty, or enjoyment of Nature. It is necessary to
sound a loud alarm, to present the facts in very strong language,
backed up by irrefutable statistics and by photographs which tell no
lies, to establish the law and enforce it if needs be with a
bludgeon.
</p>
<p>
This book is such an alarm call. Its forceful pages remind me of the
sounding of the great bells in the watch-towers of the cities of the
Middle Ages which called the citizens to arms to protect their
homes, their liberties and their happiness. It is undeniable that
the welfare and happiness of our own and of all future generations
of Americans are at stake in this battle for the preservation of
Nature against the selfishness, the ignorance, or the cruelty of her
destroyers.
</p>
<p>
We no longer destroy great works of art. They are treasured, and
regarded as of priceless value; but we have yet to attain the state
of civilization where the destruction of a glorious work of Nature,
whether it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird, is
regarded with equal abhorrence. The whole earth is a poorer place to
live in when a colony of exquisite egrets or birds of paradise is
destroyed in order that the plumes may decorate the hat of some lady
of fashion, and ultimately find their way into the rubbish heap. The
people of all the New England States are poorer when the ignorant
whites, foreigners, or negroes of our southern states destroy the
robins and other song birds of the North for a mess of pottage.
</p>
<p>
Travels through Europe, as well as over a large part of the North
American continent, have convinced me that nowhere is Nature being
destroyed so rapidly as in the United States. Except within our
conservation areas, an earthly paradise is being turned into an
earthly hades; and it is not savages nor primitive men who are doing
this, but men and women who boast of their civilization. Air and
water are polluted, rivers and streams serve as sewers and dumping
grounds, forests are swept away and fishes are driven from the
streams. Many birds are becoming extinct, and certain mammals are on
the verge of <a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page맜iii] </span> </a> extermination. Vulgar
advertisements hide the landscape, and in all that disfigures the
wonderful heritage of the beauty of Nature to-day, we Americans are
in the lead.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the tide of destruction is ebbing, and the tide of
conservation is coming in. Americans are practical. Like all other
northern peoples, they love money and will sacrifice much for it,
but they are also full of idealism, as well as of moral and
spiritual energy. The influence of the splendid body of Americans
and Canadians who have turned their best forces of mind and language
into literature and into political power for the conservation
movement, is becoming stronger every day. Yet we are far from the
point where the momentum of conservation is strong enough to arrest
and roll back the tide of destruction; and this is especially true
with regard to our fast vanishing animal life.
</p>
<p>
The facts and figures set forth in this volume will astonish all
those lovers of Nature and friends of the animal world who are
living in a false or imaginary sense of security. The logic of these
facts is inexorable. As regards our birds and mammals, the failures
of supposed protection in America&mdash;under a system of free
shooting&mdash;are so glaring that we are confident this exposure
will lead to sweeping reforms. The author of this work is no amateur
in the field of wild-life protection. His ideas concerning methods
of reform are drawn from long and successful experience. The states
which are still behind in this movement may well give serious heed
to his summons, and pass the new laws that are so urgently demanded
to save the vanishing remnant.
</p>
<p>
The New York Zoological Society, which is cooperating with many
other organizations in this great movement, sends forth this work in
the belief that there is no one who is more ardently devoted to the
great cause or rendering more effective service in it than William
T. Hornaday. We believe that this is a great book, destined to exert
a world-wide influence, to be translated into other languages, and
to arouse the defenders and lovers of our vanishing animal life
before it is too late.

		PREFACE
	</div>
</div>
<p>
The writing of this book has taught me many things. Beyond question,
we are exterminating our finest species of mammals, birds and fishes
<i> according to law! </i>
</p>
<p>
I am appalled by the mass of evidence proving that throughout the
entire United States and Canada, in every state and province, the
existing legal system for the preservation of wild life is fatally
defective. There is not a single state in our country from which the
killable game is not being rapidly and persistently shot to death,
legally or illegally, very much more rapidly than it is breeding,
with extermination for the most of it close in sight. This statement
is not open to argument; for millions of men know that it is
literally true. We are living in a fool's paradise.
</p>
<p>
The rage for wild-life slaughter is far more prevalent to-day
throughout the world than it was in 1872, when the buffalo butchers
paved the prairies of Texas and Colorado with festering carcasses.
From one end of our continent to the other, there is a restless,
resistless desire to "kill, <i> kill!</i>"
</p>
<p>
I have been shocked by the accumulation of evidence showing that all
over our country and Canada fully nine-tenths of our protective laws
have practically been dictated by the killers of the game, and that
in all save a very few instances the hunters have been exceedingly
careful to provide "open seasons" for slaughter, as long as any game
remains to kill!
</p>
<p>
<i> And yet, the game of North America does not belong wholly and
exclusively to the men who kill! The other ninety-seven per cent of
the People have vested rights in it, far exceeding those of the
three per cent. Posterity has claims upon it that no honest man can
ignore. </i>
</p>
<p>
I am now going to ask both the true sportsman and the people who do
not kill wild things to awake, and do their plain duty in protecting
and preserving the game and other wild life which belongs partly to
us, but chiefly to those who come after us. Can they be aroused,
before it is too late?
</p>
<p>
The time to discuss tiresome academic theories regarding "bag
limits" and different "open seasons" as being sufficient to preserve
the game, has gone by! We have reached the point where the
alternatives are <i> long closed seasons or a gameless continent;
</i> and we must choose one or the other, speedily. A continent
without wild life is like a forest with no leaves on the trees.
</p>
<a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page맞] </span> </a>
<p>
The great increase in the slaughter of song birds for food, by the
negroes and poor whites of the South, has become an unbearable
scourge to our migratory birds,&mdash;the very birds on which
farmers north and south depend for protection from the insect
hordes,&mdash;the very birds that are most near and dear to the
people of the North. <i> Song-bird slaughter is growing and
spreading</i>, with the decrease of the game birds! It is a matter
that requires instant attention and stern repression. At the present
moment it seems that the only remedy lies in federal protection for
all migratory birds,&mdash;because so many states will not do their
duty.
</p>
<p>
We are weary of witnessing the greed, selfishness and cruelty of
"civilized" man toward the wild creatures of the earth. We are sick
of tales of slaughter and pictures of carnage. It is time for a
sweeping Reformation; and that is precisely what we now demand.
</p>
<p>
I have been a sportsman myself; but times have changed, and we must
change also. When game was plentiful, I believed that it was right
for men and boys to kill a limited amount of it for sport and for
the table. But the old basis has been swept away by an Army of
Destruction that now is almost beyond all control. We must awake,
and arouse to the new situation, face it like men, and adjust our
minds to the new conditions. The three million gunners of to-day
must no longer expect or demand the same generous hunting privileges
that were right for hunters fifty years ago, when game was fifty
times as plentiful as it is now and there was only one killer for
every fifty now in the field.
</p>
<p>
The fatalistic idea that bag-limit laws can save the game is to-day
<i> the curse of all our game birds, mammals and fishes! </i> It is
a fraud, a delusion and a snare. That miserable fetish has been
worshipped much too long. Our game is being exterminated,
everywhere, by blind insistence upon "open seasons," and solemn
reliance upon "legal bag-limits." If a majority of the people of
America feel that so long as there is any game alive there must be
an annual two months or four months open season for its slaughter,
then assuredly we soon will have a gameless continent.
</p>
<p>
The only thing that will save the game is by stopping the killing of
it! In establishing and promulgating this principle, the cause of
wild-life protection greatly needs three things: money, labor, and
publicity. With the first, we can secure the second and third. But
can we get it,&mdash;and <i> get it in time to save? </i>
</p>
<p>
This volume is in every sense a contribution to a Cause; and as such
it ever will remain. I wish the public to receive it on that basis.
So much important material has drifted straight to it from other
hands that this unexpected aid seems to the author like a good omen.
</p>
<p>
The manuscript has received the benefit of a close and critical
reading and correcting by my comrade on the firing-line and esteemed
friend, Mr. Madison Grant, through which the text was greatly
improved. But for the splendid encouragement and assistance that I
have received from him and <a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page맞i] </span> </a> from Professor Henry
Fairneld Osborn the work involved would have borne down rather
heavily.
</p>
<p>
The four chapters embracing the "New Laws Needed; A Roll-Call of the
States," were critically inspected, corrected and brought down to
date by Dr. T.S. Palmer, our highest authority on the game laws of
the Nation and the States. For this valuable service the author is
deeply grateful. Of course the author is alone responsible for all
the opinions and conclusions herein recorded, and for all errors
that appear outside of quotations.
</p>
<p>
I trust that the Reader will kindly excuse and forget all the
typographic and clerical errors that may have escaped me in the rush
that had to be made against Time.

the question of the extinction or preservation of our wild life, it
is necessary to recall the near past. It is not necessary, however,
to go far into the details of history; for a few quick glances at a
few high points will be quite sufficient for the purpose in view.
</p>
<p>
Any man who reads the books which best tell the story of the
development of the American colonies of 1712 into the American
nation of 1912, and takes due note of the wild-life features of the
tale, will say without hesitation that when the American people
received this land from the bountiful hand of Nature, it was endowed
with a magnificent and all-pervading supply of valuable wild
creatures. The pioneers and the early settlers were too busy even to
take due note of that fact, or to comment upon it, save in very
fragmentary ways.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the wild-life abundance of early American days
survived down to so late a period that it touched the lives of
millions of people now living. Any man 55 years of age who when a
boy had a taste for "hunting,"&mdash;for at that time there were no
"sportsmen" in America,&mdash;will remember the flocks and herds of
wild creatures that he saw and which made upon his mind many
indelible impressions.
</p>
<p>
"Abundance" is the word with which to describe the original animal
life that stocked our country, and all North America, only a short
half-century ago. Throughout every state, on every shore-line, in
all the millions of fresh water lakes, ponds and rivers, on every
mountain range, in every forest, <i> and even on every desert</i>,
the wild flocks and herds held sway. It was impossible to go beyond
the settled haunts of civilized man and escape them.
</p>
<p>
It was a full century after the complete settlement of New England
and the Virginia colonies that the wonderful big-game fauna of the
great plains and Rocky Mountains was really discovered; but the
bison <a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page2]
</span> </a> millions, the antelope millions, the mule deer, the
mountain sheep and mountain goat were there, all the time. In the
early days, the millions of pinnated grouse and quail of the central
states attracted no serious attention from the American
people-at-large; but they lived and flourished just the same, far
down in the seventies, when the greedy market gunners systematically
slaughtered them, and barreled them up for "the market," while the
foolish farmers calmly permitted them to do it.
</p>
<p>
We obtain the best of our history of the former abundance of North
American wild life first from the pages of Audubon and Wilson; next,
from the records left by such pioneers as Lewis and Clark, and last
from the testimony of living men. To all this we can, many of us,
add observations of our own.
</p>
<p>
To me the most striking fact that stands forth in the story of
American wild life one hundred years ago is the wide extent and
thoroughness of its distribution. Wide as our country is, and
marvelous as it is in the diversity of its climates, its soils, its
topography, its flora, its riches and its poverty, Nature gave to
each square mile and to each acre a generous quota of wild
creatures, according to its ability to maintain living things. No
pioneer ever pushed so far, or into regions so difficult or so
remote, that he did not find awaiting him a host of birds and
beasts. Sometimes the pioneer was not a good hunter; usually he was
a stupid fisherman; but the "game" was there, nevertheless. The time
was when every farm had its quota.
</p>
<p>
The part that the wild life of America played in the settlement and
development of this continent was so far-reaching in extent, and so
enormous in potential value, that it fairly staggers the
imagination. From the landing of the Pilgrims down to the present
hour the wild game has been the mainstay and the resource against
starvation of the pathfinder, the settler, the prospector, and at
times even the railroad-builder. In view of what the bison millions
did for the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Texas, it is only
right and square that those states should now do something for the
perpetual preservation of the bison species and all other big game
that needs help.
</p>
<p>
For years and years, the antelope millions of the Montana and
Wyoming grass-lands fed the scout and Indian-fighter, freighter,
cowboy and surveyor, ranchman <i> and sheep-herder</i>; but thus far
I have yet to hear of one Western state that has ever spent one
penny directly for the preservation of the antelope! And to-day we
are in a hand-to-hand fight in Congress, and in Montana, with the
Wool-Growers Association, which maintains in Washington a keen
lobbyist to keep aloft the tariff on wool, and prevent Congress from
taking 15 square miles of grass lands on Snow Creek, Montana, for a
National Antelope Preserve. All that the wool-growers want is the
entire earth, all to themselves. Mr. McClure, the Secretary of the
Association says:
</p>
<p>
"The proper place in which to preserve the big game of the West is
in city parks, where it can be protected."
</p>
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page3] </span> </a>
<p>
To the colonist of the East and pioneer of the West, the
white-tailed deer was an ever present help in time of trouble.
Without this omnipresent animal, and the supply of good meat that
each white flag represented, the commissariat difficulties of the
settlers who won the country as far westward as Indiana would have
been many times greater than they were. The backwoods Pilgrim's
progress was like this:
</p>
<p>
Trail, deer; cabin, deer; clearing; bear, corn, deer; hogs, deer;
cattle, wheat, independence.
</p>
<p>
And yet, how many men are there to-day, out of our ninety millions
of Americans and pseudo-Americans, who remember with any feeling of
gratitude the part played in American history by the white-tailed
deer? Very few! How many Americans are there in our land who now
preserve that deer for sentimental reasons, and because his forbears
were nation-builders? As a matter of fact, are there any?
</p>
<p>
On every eastern pioneer's monument, the white-tailed deer should
figure; and on those of the Great West, the bison and the antelope
should be cast in enduring bronze, "<i>lest we forget!</i>"
</p>
<p>
The game birds of America played a different part from that of the
deer, antelope and bison. In the early days, shotguns were few, and
shot was scarce and dear. The wild turkey and goose were the
smallest birds on which a rifleman could afford to expend a bullet
and a whole charge of powder. It was for this reason that the deer,
bear, bison, and elk disappeared from the eastern United States
while the game birds yet remained abundant. With the disappearance
of the big game came the fat steer, hog and hominy, the wheat-field,
fruit orchard and poultry galore.
</p>
<p>
The game birds of America, as a class and a mass, have not been
swept away to ward off starvation or to rescue the perishing. Even
back in the sixties and seventies, very, very few men of the North
thought of killing prairie chickens, ducks and quail, snipe and
woodcock, in order to keep the hunger wolf from the door. The
process was too slow and uncertain; and besides, the really-poor man
rarely had the gun and ammunition. Instead of attempting to live on
birds, he hustled for the staple food products that the soil of his
own farm could produce.
</p>
<p>
First, last and nearly all the time, the game birds of the United
States as a whole, have been sacrificed on the altar of Rank Luxury,
to tempt appetites that were tired of fried chicken and other farm
delicacies. To-day, even the average poor man hunts birds for the
joy of the outing, and the pampered epicures of the hotels and
restaurants buy game birds, and eat small portions of them, solely
to tempt jaded appetites. If there is such a thing as "class"
legislation, it is that which permits a few sordid market-shooters
to slaughter the birds of the whole people in order to sell them to
a few epicures.
</p>
<p>
The game of a state belongs to the whole people of the state. The
Supreme Court of the United States has so decided. (Geer vs.
Connecticut). If it is abundant, it is a valuable asset. The great
value of the game birds of America lies not in their meat pounds as
they lie upon <a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page4] </span> </a> the table, but in the temptation they annually
put before millions of field-weary farmers and desk-weary clerks and
merchants to get into their beloved hunting togs, stalk out into the
lap of Nature, and say "Begone, dull Care!"
</p>
<p>
And the man who has had a fine day in the painted woods, on the
bright waters of a duck-haunted bay, or in the golden stubble of
September, can fill his day and his soul with six good birds just as
well as with sixty. The idea that in order to enjoy a fine day in
the open a man must kill a wheel-barrow load of birds, is a mistaken
idea; and if obstinately adhered to, it becomes vicious! The Outing
in the Open is the thing,&mdash;not the blood-stained feathers,
nasty viscera and Death in the game-bag. One quail on a fence is
worth more to the world than ten in a bag.
</p>
<p>
The farmers of America have, by their own supineness and lack of
foresight, permitted the slaughter of a stock of game birds which,
had it been properly and wisely conserved, would have furnished a
good annual shoot to every farming man and boy of sporting instincts
through the past, right down to the present, and far beyond. They
have allowed millions of dollars worth of <i> their </i> birds to be
coolly snatched away from them by the greedy market-shooters.
</p>
<p>
There is one state in America, and so far as I know <i> only
one</i>, in which there is at this moment an old-time abundance of
game-bird life. That is the state of Louisiana. The reason is not so
very far to seek. For the birds that do not migrate,&mdash;quail,
wild turkeys and doves,&mdash;the cover is yet abundant. For the
migratory game birds of the Mississippi Valley, Louisiana is a grand
central depot, with terminal facilities that are unsurpassed. Her
reedy shores, her vast marshes, her long coast line and abundance of
food furnish what should be not only a haven but a heaven for ducks
and geese. After running the gauntlet of guns all the way from
Manitoba and Ontario to the Sunk Lands of Arkansas, the shores of
the Gulf must seem like heaven itself.
</p>
<p>
The great forests of Louisiana shelter deer, turkeys, and
fur-bearing animals galore; and rabbits and squirrels abound.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, this abundance of game has given rise to an extensive
industry in shooting for the market. The "big interests" outside the
state send their agents into the best game districts, often bringing
in their own force of shooters. They comb out the game in enormous
quantities, without leaving to the people of Louisiana any decent
and fair quid-pro-quo for having despoiled them of their game and
shipped a vast annual product outside, to create wealth elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
At present, however, we are but incidentally interested in the
short-sightedness of the people of the Pelican State. As a state of
oldtime abundance in killable game, the killing records that were
kept in the year 1909-10 possess for us very great interest. They
throw a startling searchlight on the subject of this
chapter,&mdash;the former abundance of wild life.
</p>
<p>
From the records that with great pains and labor were gathered by
the State Game Commission, and which were furnished me for use here
by <a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page5]
</span> </a> President Frank M. Miller, we set forth this remarkable
exhibit of old-fashioned abundance in game, A.D. 1909.

<p>
Of the thousands of slaughtered robins, it would seem that no
records exist. It is to be understood that the annual slaughter of
wild life in Louisiana never before reached such a pitch as now.
Without drastic measures, what will be the inevitable result? Does
any man suppose that even the wild millions of Louisiana can long
withstand such slaughter as that shown by the official figures given
above? It is wildly impossible.
</p>
<p>
But the darkest hour is just before the dawn. At the session of the
Louisiana legislature that was held in the spring of 1912, great
improvements were made in the game laws of that state. The most
important feature was the suppression of wholesale market hunting,
by persons who are not residents of the state. A very limited amount
of game may be sold and served as food in public places, but the
restrictions placed upon this traffic are so effective that they
will vastly reduce the annual slaughter. In other respects, also,
the cause of wild life protection gained much; for which great
credit is due to Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny.
</p>
<p>
It is the way of Americans to feel that because game is abundant in
a given place at a given time, it always will be abundant, and may
therefore be slaughtered without limit. That was the case last
winter in California during the awful slaughter of band-tailed
pigeons, as will be noted elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
It is time for all men to be told in the plainest terms that there
never has existed, anywhere in historic times, a volume of wild life
so great that civilized man could not quickly exterminate it by his
methods of <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page6] </span> </a> destruction. Lift the veil and look at the
stories of the bison, the passenger pigeon, the wild ducks and shore
birds of the Atlantic coast, and the fur-seal.

<p class="captionheading">
	SHALL WE LEAVE ANY ONE OF THEM OPEN?
</p>
<p>
As reasoning beings, it is our duty to heed the lessons of history,
and not rush blindly on until we perpetrate a continent destitute of
wild life.

	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		EXTINCT SPECIES OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS
	</div>
</div>
<p>
For educated, civilized Man to exterminate a valuable wild species
of living things is a crime. It is a crime against his own children,
and posterity.
</p>
<p>
No man has a right, either moral or legal, to destroy or squander an
inheritance of his children that he holds for them in trust. And
man, the wasteful and greedy spendthrift that he is, has not created
even the humblest of the species of birds, mammals and fishes that
adorn and enrich this earth. "The earth is THE LORD'S, and the
fulness thereof!" With all his wisdom, man has not evolved and
placed here so much as a ground-squirrel, a sparrow or a clam. It is
true that he has juggled with the wild horse and sheep, the goats
and the swine, and produced some hardy breeds that can withstand his
abuse without going down before it; but as for species, he has not
yet created and placed here even so much as a protozoan.
</p>
<p>
The wild things of this earth are <i> not </i> ours, to do with as
we please. They have been given to us <i> in trust</i>, and we must
account for them to the generations which will come after us and
audit our accounts.
</p>
<p>
But man, the shameless destroyer of Nature's gifts, blithely and
persistently exterminates one species after another. Fully ten per
cent of the human race consists of people who will lie, steal, throw
rubbish in parks, and destroy forests and wild life whenever and
wherever they can do so without being stopped by a policemen and a
club. These are hard words, but they are absolutely true. From ten
per cent (or more) of the human race, the high moral instinct which
is honest without compulsion <i> is absent</i>. The things that
seemingly decent citizens,&mdash;men posing as gentlemen,&mdash;will
do to wild game when they secure great chances to slaughter, are
appalling. I could fill a book of this size with cases in point.
</p>
<p>
To-day the women of England, Europe and elsewhere are directly
promoting the extermination of scores of beautiful species of wild
birds by the devilish persistence with which they buy and wear
feather ornaments made of their plumage. They are just as mean and
cruel as the truck-driver who drives a horse with a sore shoulder
and beats him on the street. But they do it! And appeals to them to
do otherwise they laugh to scorn, saying, "I will wear what is
fashionable, when I please and where I please!" As a famous bird
protector of England has just written me, "The women of the smart
set are beyond the reach of appeal or protest."
</p>
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page8] </span> </a>
<p>
To-day, the thing that stares me in the face every waking hour, like
a grisly spectre with bloody fang and claw, is <i> the extermination
of species</i>. To me, that is a horrible thing. It is wholesale
murder, no less. It is capital crime, and a black disgrace to the
races of civilized mankind. I say "civilized mankind," because
savages don't do it!
</p>
<p>
There are three kinds of extermination:
</p>
<p>
<i> The practical extermination of a species </i> means the
destruction of its members to an extent so thorough and widespread
that the species disappears from view, and living specimens of it
can not be found by seeking for them. In North America this is
to-day the status of the whooping crane, upland plover, and several
other species. If any individuals are living, they will be met with
only by accident.
</p>
<p>
<i> The absolute extermination </i> of a species means that not one
individual of it remains alive. Judgment to this effect is based
upon the lapse of time since the last living specimen was observed
or killed. When five years have passed without a living "record" of
a wild specimen, it is time to place a species in the class of the
totally extinct.
</p>
<p>
<i> Extermination in a wild state </i> means that the only living
representatives are in captivity or otherwise under protection. This
is the case of the heath hen and David's deer, of China. The
American bison is saved from being wholly extinct as a wild animal
by the remnant of about 300 head in northern Athabasca, and 49 head
in the Yellow-stone Park.
</p>
<p>
It is a serious thing to exterminate a species of any of the
vertebrate animals. There are probably millions of people who do not
realize that civilized (!) man is the most persistently and wickedly
wasteful of all the predatory animals. The lions, the tigers, the
bears, the eagles and hawks, serpents, and the fish-eating fishes,
all live by destroying life; but they kill only what they think they
can consume. If something is by chance left over, it goes to satisfy
the hunger of the humbler creatures of prey. <i> In a state of
nature, where wild creatures prey upon wild creatures, such a thing
as wanton, wholesale and utterly wasteful slaughter is almost
unknown! </i>
</p>
<p>
When the wild mink, weasel and skunk suddenly finds himself in the
midst of scores of man's confined and helpless domestic fowls, or
his caged gulls in a zoological park, an unusual criminal passion to
murder for the joy of killing sometimes seizes the wild animal, and
great slaughter is the result.
</p>
<p>
From the earliest historic times, it has been the way of savage man,
red, black, brown and yellow, to kill as the wild animals
do,&mdash;only what he can use, or <i> thinks </i> he can use. The
Cree Indian impounded small herds of bison, and sometimes killed
from 100 to 200 at one time; but it was to make sure of having
enough meat and hides, and because he expected to use the product. I
think that even the worst enemies of the plains Indians hardly will
accuse them of killing large numbers of bison, elk or deer merely
for the pleasure of seeing them fall, or taking only their teeth.

<p>
It has remained for the wolf, the sheep-killing dog and civilized
man to make records of wanton slaughter which puts them in a class
together, <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page10] </span> </a> and quite apart from other predatory animals.
When a man can kill bison for their tongues alone, bull elk for
their "tusks" alone, and shoot a whole colony of
hippopotami,&mdash;actually damming a river with their bloated and
putrid carcasses, all untouched by the knife,&mdash;the men who do
such things must be classed with the cruel wolf and the criminal
dog.
</p>
<p>
It is now desirable that we should pause in our career of
destruction long enough to look back upon what we have recently
accomplished in the total extinction of species, and also note what
we have blocked out for the immediate future. Here let us erect a
monument to the dead species of our own times.
</p>
<p>
It is to be doubted whether, up to this hour, any man has made a
list of the species of North American birds that have become extinct
during the past sixty years. The specialists have no time to spare
from their compound differential microscopes, and the bird-killers
are too busy with shooting, netting and clubbing to waste any time
on such trifles as exterminated species. What does a market-shooter
care about birds that can not be killed a second time? As for the
farmers, they are so busy raising hogs and prices that their best
friends, the birds, get scant attention from them,&mdash;until a
hen-hawk takes a chicken!
</p>
<p>
Down South, the negroes and poor whites may slaughter robins for
food by the ten thousand; but does the northern farmer bother his
head about a trifle of that kind? No, indeed. Will he contribute any
real money to help put a stop to it? Ask him yourself.
</p>
<p>
Let us pause long enough to reckon up some of our expenditures in
species, and in millions of individuals. Let us set down here, in
cold blood, a list of the species of our own North American birds
that have been totally exterminated in our own times. After that we
will have something to say about other species that soon will be
exterminated; and the second task is much greater than the first.

	ROLL CALL OF THE DEAD SPECIES OF AMERICAN BIRDS
</div>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Great Auk, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Plautus impennis</i>, </span> (Linn.), was a sea-going diving bird about the size of a domestic goose, related to the guillemots, murres and puffins. For a bird endowed only with flipper-like wings, and therefore absolutely unable to fly, this species had an astonishing geographic range. It embraced the shores of northern Europe to North Cape, southern Greenland, southern Labrador, and the Atlantic coast of North America as far south as Massachusetts. Some say, "as far south as Massachusetts, the Carolinas and Florida," but that is a large order, and I leave the A.O.U. to prove that if it can. In the life history of this bird, a great tragedy was enacted in 1800 by sailors, on Funk Island, north of Newfoundland, where men were landed by a ship, and spent several months slaughtering great auks and trying out their fat for oil. In this process, the bodies of thousands of auks were burned as fuel, in working up the remains of tens of thousands of others.
</p>
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page11] </span> </a>
<p>
On Funk Island, a favorite breeding-place, the great auk was
exterminated in 1840, and in Iceland in 1844. Many natives ate this
bird with relish, and being easily captured, either on land or sea,
the commercialism of its day soon obliterated the species. The last
living specimen was seen in 1852, and the last dead one was picked
up in Trinity Bay, Ireland, in 1853. There are about 80 mounted and
unmounted skins in existence, four skeletons, and quite a number of
eggs. An egg is worth about $1200 and a good mounted skin at least
double that sum.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Labrador Duck, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Camptorhynchus labradoricus</i>, </span> (Gmel.).&mdash;This handsome sea-duck, of a species related to the eider ducks of arctic waters, became totally extinct about 1875, before the scientific world even knew that its existence was threatened. With this species, the exact and final cause of its extinction is to this day unknown. It is not at all probable, however, that its unfortunate blotting out from our bird fauna was due to natural causes, and when the truth becomes known, it is very probable that the hand of man will be revealed.
</p>
<p>
The Labrador duck bred in Labrador, and once frequented our Atlantic
coast as far south as Chesapeake Bay; but it is said that it never
was very numerous, at least during the twenty-five years preceding
its disappearance. About thirty-five skins and mounted museum
specimens are all that remain to prove its former existence, and I
think there is not even one skeleton.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Pallas Cormorant, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Carbo perspicillatus</i>, </span> (Pallas).&mdash;In 1741, when the Russian explorer, Commander Bering, discovered the Bering or Commander Islands, in the far-north Pacific, and landed upon them, he also discovered this striking bird species. Its plumage both above and below was a dark metallic green, with blue iridescence on the neck and purple on the shoulders. A pale ring of naked skin around each eye suggested the Latin specific name of this bird. The Pallas cormorant became totally extinct, through causes not positively known, about 1852.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Passenger Pigeon, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Ectopistes migratoria</i>, </span> (Linn.).&mdash;We place this bird in the totally-extinct class, not only because it is extinct in a wild state, but only one solitary individual, a twenty-year-old female in the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens, now remains alive. One living specimen and a few skins, skeletons and stuffed specimens are all that remain to show for the uncountable millions of pigeons that swarmed over the United States, only yesterday as it were!
</p>
<p>
There is no doubt about where those millions have gone. They went
down and out by systematic, wholesale slaughter for the market and
the pot, before the shotguns, <i> clubs </i> and <i> nets </i> of
the earliest American pot-hunters. Wherever they nested they were
slaughtered.
</p>
<p>
It is a long and shameful story, but the grisly skeleton of its
Michigan chapter can be set forth in a few words. In 1869, from the
town of Hartford, Mich., <i> three car loads </i> of dead pigeons
were shipped to market each day for <i> forty days</i>, making a
total of 11,880,000 birds. It is recorded that another Michigan town
marketed 15,840,000 in two years. (See Mr. W.B. Mershon's book, "The
Passenger Pigeon.")
</p>
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page12] </span> </a>
<p>
Alexander Wilson, the pioneer American ornithologist, was the man
who seriously endeavored to estimate by computations the total
number of passenger pigeons in one flock that was seen by him. Here
is what he has said in his "American Ornithology":
</p>
<p>
"To form a rough estimate of the daily consumption of one of these
immense flocks, let us first attempt to calculate the numbers of
that above mentioned, as seen in passing between Frankfort and the
Indiana territory. If we suppose this column to have been one mile
in breadth (and I believe it to have been much more) and that it
moved at the rate of one mile in a minute, four hours, the time it
continued passing, would make its whole length two hundred and forty
miles. Again, supposing that each square yard of this moving body
comprehended three pigeons; the square yards in the whole space
multiplied by three would give 2,230,272,000 pigeons! An almost
inconceivable multitude, and yet probably far below the actual
amount."
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p>
"Happening to go ashore one charming afternoon, to purchase some
milk at a house that stood near the river, and while talking with
the people within doors, I was suddenly struck with astonishment at
a loud rushing roar, succeeded by instant darkness, which, on the
first moment, I took for a tornado about to overwhelm the house and
every thing around in destruction. The people observing my surprise,
coolly said, 'It is only the pigeons!' On running out I beheld a
flock, thirty or forty yards in width, sweeping along very low,
between the house and the mountain or height that formed the second
bank of the river. These continued passing for more than a quarter
of an hour, and at length varied their bearing so as to pass over
the mountains, behind which they disappeared before the rear came
up.
</p>
<p>
"In the Atlantic States, though they never appear in such
unparalleled multitudes, they are sometimes very numerous; and great
havoc is then made amongst them with the gun, the clap-net, and
various other implements of destruction. As soon as it is
ascertained in a town that the pigeons are flying numerously in the
neighborhood, the gunners rise <i> en masse</i>; the clap-nets are
spread out on suitable situations, commonly on an open height in an
old buckwheat field, four or five live pigeons, <i> with their
eyelids sewed up</i>, <a name="FNanchorA" id="FNanchorA"> </a> <a
class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_A"> [A] </a> are fastened on
a movable stick, a small hut of branches is fitted up for the fowler
at the distance of forty or fifty yards. By the pulling of a string,
the stick on which the pigeons rest is alternately elevated and
depressed, which produces a fluttering of their wings, similar to
that of birds alighting. This being perceived by the passing flocks,
they descend with great rapidity, and finding corn, buckwheat, etc,
strewed about, begin to feed, and are instantly, by the pulling of a
cord, covered by the net. In this manner ten, twenty, and even
thirty dozen have been caught <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page13] </span> </a> at one sweep. Meantime the
air is darkened with large bodies of them moving in various
directions; the woods also swarm with them in search of acorns, and
the thundering of musquetry is perpetual on all sides from morning
to night. Wagon loads of them are poured into market, where they
sell from fifty to twenty-five and even twelve cents per dozen; and
pigeons become the order of the day at dinner, breakfast and supper,
until the very name becomes sickening."
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p>
The range of the passenger pigeon covered nearly the whole United
States from the Atlantic coast westward to the Rocky Mountains. A
few bold pigeons crossed the Rocky Mountains into Oregon, northern
California and Washington, but only as "stragglers," few and far
between. The wide range of this bird was worthy of a species that
existed in millions, and it was persecuted literally all along the
line. The greatest slaughter was in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
In 1848 Massachusetts gravely passed a law protecting the <i>
netters </i> of wild pigeons from foreign interference! There was a
fine of $10 for damaging nets, or frightening pigeons away from
them. This was on the theory that the pigeons were so abundant they
could not by any possibility ever become scarce, and that
pigeon-slaughter was a legitimate industry.
</p>
<p>
In 1867, the State of New York found that the wild pigeon needed
protection, and enacted a law to that effect. The year 1868 was the
last year in which great numbers of passenger pigeons nested in that
State. Eaton, in "The Birds of New York," said that "millions of
birds occupied the timber along Bell's Run, near Ceres, Alleghany
County, on the Pennsylvania line."
</p>
<p>
In 1870, Massachusetts gave pigeons protection except during an
"open season," and in 1878 Pennsylvania elected to protect pigeons
on their nesting grounds.
</p>
<p>
The passenger pigeon millions were destroyed so quickly, and so
thoroughly <i> en masse</i>, that the American people utterly failed
to comprehend it, and for thirty years obstinately refused to
believe that the species had been suddenly wiped off the map of
North America. There was years of talk about the great flocks having
"taken refuge in South America," or in Mexico, and being still in
existence. There were surmises about their having all "gone out to
sea," and perished on the briny deep.
</p>
<p>
A thousand times, at least, wild pigeons have been "reported" as
having been "seen." These rumors have covered nearly every northern
state, the whole of the southwest, and California. For years and
years we have been patiently writing letters to explain over and
over that the band-tailed pigeon of the Pacific coast, and the
red-billed pigeon of Arizona and the southwest are neither of them
the passenger pigeon, and never can be.
</p>
<p>
There was a long period wherein we believed many of the pigeon
reports that came from the states where the birds once were most
numerous; but that period has absolutely passed. During the past
five years large cash <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page14] </span> </a> rewards, aggregating about
$5000, have been offered for the discovery of one nesting pair of
genuine passenger pigeons. Many persons have claimed this reward (of
Professor C.F. Hodge, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass.), and
many claims have been investigated. The results have disclosed many
<i> mourning doves</i>, but not one pigeon. Now we understand that
the quest is closed, and hope has been abandoned.
</p>
<p>
The passenger pigeon is a dead species. The last wild specimen (so
we believe) that ever will reach the hands of man, was taken near
Detroit, Michigan, on Sept. 14, 1908, and mounted by C. Campion.
That is the one definite, positive record of the past ten years.
</p>
<p>
The fate of this species should be a lasting lesson to the world at
large. Any wild bird or mammal species can be exterminated by
commercial interests in twenty years time, or less.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Eskimo Curlew, </span> <span class="latin"> <i> &mdash;Numenius borealis</i>, </span> (Forst.). This valuable game bird once ranged all along the Atlantic coast of North America, and wherever found it was prized for the table. It preferred the fields and meadows to the shore lines, and was the companion of the plovers of the uplands, especially the golden plover. "About 1872," says Mr. Forbush, "there was a great flight of these birds on Cape Cod and Nantucket. They were everywhere; and enormous numbers were killed. They could be bought of boys at six cents apiece. Two men killed $300 worth of these birds at that time."
</p>
<p>
Apparently, that was the beginning of the end of the "dough bird,"
which was another name for this curlew. In 1908 Mr. G.H. Mackay
stated that this bird and the golden plover had decreased 90 per
cent in fifty years, and in the last ten years of that period 90 per
cent of the remainder had gone. "Now (1908)," says Mr. Forbush,
"ornithologists believe that the Eskimo curlew is practically
extinct, as only a few specimens have been recorded since the
beginning of the twentieth century." The very last record is of two
specimens collected at Waco, York County, Nebraska, in March, 1911,
and recorded by Mr. August Eiche. Of course, it is possible that
other individuals may still survive; but so far as our knowledge
extends, the species is absolutely dead.

<p>
In the West Indies and the Guadeloupe Islands, five species of
macaws and parrakeets have passed out without any serious note of
their disappearance on the part of the people of the United States.
It is at least time to write brief obituary notices of them.
</p>
<p>
We are indebted to the Hon. Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England,
for essential facts regarding these species as set forth in his
sumptuous work "Extinct Birds".
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Cuban Tricolored Macaw, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Ara tricolor</i>, </span> (Gm.). In 1875, when the author visited Cuba and the Isle of Pines, he was informed by Professor Poey that he was "about ten years too late" to find this fine species alive. It was exterminated for food purposes, about 1864, and only four specimens are known to be in existence.

	<span class="title"> Gosse's Macaw, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Ara gossei</i>, </span> (Roth.).&mdash;This species once inhabited the Island of Jamaica. It was exterminated about 1800, and so far as known not one specimen of it is in existence.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Guadeloupe Macaw, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Ara guadeloupensis</i>, </span> (Clark).&mdash;All that is known of the life history of this large bird is that once it inhabited the Guadeloupe Islands. The date and history of its disappearance are both unknown, and there is not one specimen of it in existence.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Yellow-Winged Green Parrot, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Amazona olivacea</i>, </span> (Gm.).&mdash;Of the history of this Guadeloupe species, also, nothing is known, and there appear to be no specimens of it in existence.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Purple Guadeloupe Parrakeet, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Anodorhynchus purpurescens</i>, </span> (Rothschild).&mdash;This is another dead species, that once lived in the Guadeloupe Islands, and passed away silently and unnoticed at the time, leaving no records of its existence, and no specimens.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Carolina Parrakeet, </span> <span class="latin"> &mdash;<i>Conuropsis carolinensis</i>, </span> (Linn.), brings us down to the present moment. To this charming little green-and-yellow bird, we are in the very act of bidding everlasting farewell. Ten specimens remain alive in captivity, six of which are in the Cincinnati Zoological Garden, three are in the Washington Zoological Park and one is in the New York Zoological Park.
</p>
<p>
Regarding wild specimens, it is possible that some yet remain, in
some obscure and <i> neglected </i> corner of Florida; but it is
extremely doubtful whether the world ever will find any of them
alive. Mrs. Minnie Moore Willson, of Kissimee, Fla. reports the
species as totally extinct in Florida. Unless we would strain at a
gnat, we may just as well enter this species in the dead class; for
there is no reason to hope that any more wild specimens ever will be
found.
</p>
<p>
The former range of this species embraced the whole southeastern and
central United States. From the Gulf it extended to Albany, N.Y.,
northern Ohio and Indiana, northern Iowa, Nebraska, central Colorado
and eastern Texas, from which it will be seen that once it was
widely distributed. It was shot because it was destructive to fruit
and for its plumage, and many were trapped alive, to be kept in
captivity. I know that one colony, near the mouth of the Sebastian
River, east coast of Florida, was exterminated in 1898 by a local
hunter, and I regret to say that it was done in the hope of selling
the living birds to a New York bird-dealer. By holding bags over the
holes in which the birds were nesting, the entire colony, of about
16 birds, was caught.
</p>
<p>
Everywhere else than in Florida, the Carolina parrakeet has long
been extinct. In 1904 a flock of 13 birds was seen near Lake
Okechobee; but in Florida many calamities can overtake a flock of
birds in eight years. The birds in captivity are not breeding, and
so far as perpetuation by them is concerned, they are only one
remove from mounted museum specimens. This parrakeet is the only
member of its order that ranged into the United States during our
own times, and with its disappearance the Order Psittaciformes
totally disappears from our country.

<p>
In the world of human beings, murder is the most serious of all
crimes. To take from a man that which no one ever can restore to
him, his life, is murder; and its penalty is the most severe of all
penalties.
</p>
<p>
There are circumstances under which the killing of a wild animal may
be so wanton, so revolting and so utterly reprehensible that the act
may justly be classed as murder. The man who kills a walrus from the
deck of a steamer that he knows will not stop; the man who wantonly
killed the whole colony of hippopotami that Mr. Dugmore photographed
in life; the man who last winter shot bull elk in Wyoming for their
two ugly and shapeless teeth, and the man who wantonly shot down a
half-tame deer "for fun" near Carmel, Putnam County, New York, in
the summer of 1912,&mdash;all were guilty of <i> murdering </i> wild
animals.
</p>
<p>
The murder of a wild animal species consists in taking from it that
which man with all his cunning and all his preserves and breeding
can not give back to it,&mdash;its God-given place in the ranks of
Living Things. Where is man's boasted intelligence, or his sense of
proportion, that every man does not see the monstrous moral
obliquity involved in the destruction of a species!
</p>
<p>
If the beautiful Taj Mehal at Agra should be destroyed by vandals,
the intelligent portion of humanity would be profoundly shocked,
even though the hand of man could at will restore the shrine of
sorrowing love. To-day the great Indian rhinoceros, certainly one of
the most wonderful four-footed animals still surviving, is actually
being exterminated; and even the people of India and England are
viewing it with an indifference that is appalling. Of course there
are among Englishmen a great many sportsmen and several zoologists
who really care; but they do not constitute one-tenth of one
per-cent of the men who ought to care!
</p>
<p>
In the museums, we stand in awe and wonder before the fossil
skeleton of the Megatherium, and the savants struggle to unveil its
past, while the equally great and marvelous <i> Rhinoceros indicus
</i> is being rushed into oblivion. We marvel at the fossil shell of
the gigantic turtle called <i> Collosochelys atlas</i>, while the
last living representatives of the gigantic land tortoises are being
exterminated in the Galapagos Islands and the Sychelles, for their
paltry oil and meat; and only one man (Hon. Walter Rothschild) is
doing aught to save any of them in their haunts, where they can
breed. The dodo of Mauritius was exterminated by swine, whose
bipedal descendants have exterminated many other species since that
time.
</p>
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page18] </span> </a>
<p>
A failure to appreciate either the beauty or the value of our living
birds, quadrupeds and fishes is the hall-mark of arrested mental
development and ignorance. The victim is <i> not always to
blame</i>; but in this practical world the cornerstone of legal
jurisprudence is the inexorable principle that "ignorance of the law
excuses no man."
</p>
<p>
These pages are addressed to my countrymen, and the world at large,
not as a reproach upon the dead Past which is gone beyond recall,
but in the faint hope of somewhere and somehow arousing forces that
will reform the Present and save the Future. The extermination of
wild species that now is proceeding throughout the world, is a
dreadful thing. It is not only injurious to the economy of the
world, but it is a shame and a disgrace to the civilized portion of
the human race.
</p>
<p>
It is of little avail that I should here enter into a detailed
description of each species that now is being railroaded into
oblivion. The bookshelves of intelligent men and women are filled
with beautiful and adequate books on birds and quadrupeds, wherein
the status of each species may be determined, almost without effort.
There is time and space only in which to notice the most prominent
of the doomed species, and perhaps discuss a few examples by way of
illustration. Here is a

	<span class="title"> The Whooping Crane. </span> &mdash;This splendid bird will almost certainly be the next North American species to be totally exterminated. It is the only new world rival of the numerous large and showy cranes of the old world; for the sandhill crane is not in the same class as the white, black and blue giants of Asia. We will part from our stately <i> Grus americanus </i> with profound sorrow, for on this continent we ne'er shall see his like again.
</p>
<p>
The well-nigh total disappearance of this species has been brought
close home to us by the fact that there are less than half a dozen
individuals alive in captivity, while in a wild state the bird is so
rare as to be quite unobtainable. For example, for nearly five years
an English <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page19] </span> </a> gentlemen has been offering $1,000 for a
pair, and the most enterprising bird collector in America has been
quite unable to fill the order. So far as our information extends,
the last living specimen captured was taken six or seven years ago.
The last wild birds seen and reported were observed by Ernest
Thompson Seton, who saw five below Fort McMurray, Saskatchewan,
October 16th, 1907, and by John F. Ferry, who saw one at Big Quill
Lake, Saskatchewan, in June, 1909.
</p>
<p>
The range of this species once covered the eastern two-thirds of the
continent of North America. It extended from the Atlantic coast to
the Rocky Mountains, and from Great Bear Lake to Florida and Texas.
Eastward of the Mississippi it has for twenty years been totally
extinct, and the last specimens taken alive were found in Kansas and
Nebraska.

	<span class="title"> The Trumpeter Swan. </span> &mdash;Six years ago this species was regarded as so nearly extinct that a doubting ornithological club of Boston refused to believe on hearsay evidence that the New York Zoological Park contained a pair of living birds, and a committee was appointed, to investigate in person, and report. Even at that time, skins were worth all the way from $100 to $150 each; and when swan skins sell at either of those figures it is because there are people who believe that the species either is on the verge of extinction, or has passed it. The pair referred to above <a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page20] </span> </a> was acquired in 1900. Since that time, Dr. Leonard C. Sanford procured in 1910 two living birds from a bird dealer who obtained them on the coast of Virginia. We have done our utmost to induce our pair to breed, but without any further results than nest-building.

<p>
The loss of the trumpeter swan (<i>Olor americanus</i>) will not be
so great, nor felt so keenly, as the blotting out of the whooping
crane. It so closely resembles the whistling swan that only an
ornithologist can recognize the difference, a yellow spot on the
side of the upper mandible, near its base. The whistling swan yet
remains in fair numbers, but it is to be feared that soon it will go
as the trumpeter has gone.

Once all three species inhabited portions of the southern United States; but now all three are gone from our star-spangled bird fauna. The brilliant scarlet plumage of the flamingo and ibis, and the exquisite pink rose-color and white of the spoonbill naturally attracted the evil eyes of the "milliner's taxidermists" and other bird-butchers. From Florida these birds quickly vanished. The six great breeding colonies of Flamingoes on Andros Island, Bahamas, have been reduced to two, and from Prof. E.A. Goeldi, of the State Museum Goeldi, Para, Brazil, have come bitter complaints of the slaughter of scarlet ibises in South America by plume-hunters in European pay.
</p>
<p>
I know not how other naturalists regard the future of the three
species named above, but my opinion is that unless the European
feather trade is quickly stopped as to wild plumage, they are
absolutely certain to be shot into total oblivion, within a very few
years. The plumage of these birds has so much commercial value, for
fishermen's flies as well as for women's hats, that the birds will
be killed as long as their feathers can be sold and any birds remain
alive.
</p>
<p>
Zoologically, the flamingo is the most odd and interesting bird on
the American continent except the emperor penguin. Its beak baffles
description, its long legs and webbed feet are a joke, its nesting
habits are amazing, and its food habits the despair of most
zoological-garden keepers. Millions of flamingos inhabit the shores
of a number of small lakes in the interior of equatorial East
Africa, but that species is not brilliant scarlet all over the neck
and head, as is the case with our species.
</p>
<p>
If the American flamingo, scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbill, one or
all of them, are to be saved from total extinction, efforts must be
made in each of the countries in which they breed and live. Their
preservation is distinctly a burden upon the countries of South
America that lie eastward of the Andes, and on Yucatan, Cuba and the
Bahamas. The time has come when the Government of the Bahama Islands
should sternly forbid the killing of any more flamingos, on any
pretext whatever; and if the capture of living specimens for
exhibition purposes militates against the welfare of the colonies,
<i> they should forbid that also</i>.

<p>
"The Bartramian Sandpiper, commonly known as the Upland Plover, a
bird which formerly bred on grassy hills all over the State and
migrated southward along our coasts in great flocks, is in imminent
danger of extirpation. A few still breed in Worcester and Berkshire
Counties, or Nantucket, so there is still a nucleus which, if
protected, may save the species. Five reports from localities where
this bird formerly bred give it as nearing extinction, and four as
extinct. This is one of the most useful of all birds in grass land,
feeding largely on grasshoppers and cutworms. It is one of the
finest of all birds for the table. An effort should be made at once
to save this useful species."

	<span class="title"> The Black-Capped Petrel, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Aestrelata hasitata</i>). </span> &mdash;This species is already recorded in the A.O.U. "Check list" as extinct; but it appears that this may not as yet be absolutely true. On January 1, 1912, a strange thing happened. A much battered and exhausted black-capped petrel was picked up alive in Central Park, New York, taken to the menagerie, and kept there during the few days that it survived. When it died it was sent to the American Museum; and this may easily prove to be the last living record for that species. In reality, this species might as well be listed with those totally extinct. Formerly it ranged from the Antilles to Ohio and Ontario, and the causes of its blotting out are not yet definitely known.
</p>
<p>
This ocean-going bird once had a wide range overseas in the
temperate areas of the North Atlantic. It is recorded from Ulster
County, New York, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and
Florida. It was about of the size of the common tern.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The California Condor, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Gymnogyps californianus</i>). </span> &mdash;I feel that the existence of this species hangs on a very slender thread. This is due to its alarmingly small range, the insignificant number of individuals now living, the openness of the species to attack, and the danger of its extinction by poison. Originally this remarkable bird,&mdash;the largest North American bird of prey,&mdash;ranged as far northward as the Columbia River, and southward for an unknown distance. Now its range is reduced to seven counties in southern California, although it is said to extend from Monterey Bay to Lower California, and eastward to Arizona.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the present status and the future of this bird, I have
been greatly disturbed in mind. When a unique and zoologically
important species becomes reduced in its geographic range to a small
section of a single state, it seems to me quite time for alarm. For
some time I have counted this bird as one of those threatened with
early extermination, and as I think with good reason. In view of the
swift calamities that now seem able to fall on species like
thunderbolts out of clear skies, and wipe them off the earth even
before we know that such a fate is <a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page22] </span> </a> impending, no species
of seven-county distribution is safe. Any species that is limited to
a few counties of a single state is liable to be wiped out in five
years, by poison, or traps, or lack of food.

	The Status Of The California Condor In 1912
</div>
<p class="centerflat">
	<i> By Joseph Grinnell </i>
</p>
<p>
"To my knowledge, the California Condor has been definitely observed
within the past five years in the following California counties: Los
Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Kern,
and Tulare. In parts of Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and
Kern counties the species is still fairly common, for a large bird,
probably equal in numbers to the golden eagle in those regions that
are suited to <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page23] </span> </a> it. By suitable country I mean
cattle-raising, mountainous territory, of which there are still vast
areas, and which are not likely to be put to any other use for a
very long time, if ever, on account of the lack of water.
</p>
<p>
"While in Kern County last April, I was informed by a reliable man
who lives near the Tejon Rancho that he had counted twenty-five
condors in a single day, since January 1 of the present year. These
were on the Tejon Rancho, which is an enormous cattle range covering
parts of the Tehachapi and San Emigdio Mountains.
</p>
<p>
"Our present state law provides complete protection for the condor
and its eggs; and the State Fish and Game Commission, in granting
permits for collectors, always adds the phrase&mdash;'except the
California condor and its eggs.' I know of two special permits
having been issued, but neither of these were used; that is, no
'specimens' have been taken since 1908, as far as I am aware.
</p>
<p>
"In my travels about the state, I have found that practically
everyone knows that the condor is protected. Still, there is always
the hunting element who do not hesitate to shoot anything alive and
out of the ordinary, and a certain percentage of the condors are
doubtless picked off each year by such criminals. It is possible,
also, that the mercenary egg-collector continues to take his annual
rents, though if this is done it is kept very quiet. It is my
impression that the present fatalities from all sources are fully
balanced by the natural rate of increase.
</p>
<p>
"There is one factor that has militated against the condor more than
any other one thing; namely, the restriction in its food source. Its
forage range formerly included most of the great valleys adjacent to
its mountain retreats. But now the valleys are almost entirely
devoted to agriculture, and of course far more thickly settled than
formerly.
</p>
<p>
"The mountainous areas where the condor is making its last stand
seem to me likely to remain adapted to the bird's existence for many
years,&mdash;fifty years, if not longer. Of course, this is
conditional upon the maintenance and enforcement of the present
laws. There is also the enlightenment of public sentiment in regard
to the preservation of wild life, which I believe can be depended
upon. This is a matter of general education, which is, fortunately,
and with no doubt whatever, progressing at a quite perceptible rate.
</p>
<p>
"Yes; I should say that the condor has a fair chance to survive, in
limited numbers.
</p>
<p>
"Another bird which in my opinion is far nearer extinction than the
condor, so far as California is concerned, is the white-tailed kite.
This is a perfectly harmless bird, but one which harries over the
marshes, where it has been an easy target for the idle duck-hunter.
Then, too, its range was limited to the valley bottoms, where human
settlement is increasingly close. I know of only <i> two </i> live
pairs within the state last year!
</p>
<p>
"Finally, let me remark that the rate of increase of the California
condor is not one whit less than that of the band-tailed pigeon!
Yet, <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page24] </span> </a> there is no protection at all for the latter
in this state, even in the nesting season; and thousands were shot
last spring, in the unprecedented concentration of the species in
the southern coast counties. (See Chambers in <i> The Condor </i>
for May, 1912, p. 108.)"
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p>
The California Condor is one of the only two species of condor now
living, and it is the only one found in North America. As a matter
of national pride, and a duty to posterity, the people of the United
States can far better afford to lose a million dollars from their
national treasury than to allow that bird to become extinct. Its
preservation for all coming time is distinctly a white man's burden
upon the state of California. The laws now in force for the condor's
protection are not half adequate! I think there is no law by which
the accidental poisoning of those birds, by baits put out for
coyotes and foxes, can be stopped. A law to prevent the use of
poisoned meat baits anywhere in southern California, should be
enacted at the next session of California's legislature. The fine
for molesting a condor should be raised to $500, with a long
prison-term as an alternative. A competent, interested game warden
should be appointed <i> solely for the protection of the
condors</i>. It is time to count those birds, keep them under
observation, and have an annual report upon their condition.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Heath Hen. </span> &mdash;But for the protection that has been provided for it by the ornithologists of Massachusetts, and particularly Dr. George W. Field, William Brewster and John E. Thayer, the heath hen or eastern pinnated grouse would years ago have become totally extinct. New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts began to protect that species entirely too late. It was given five-year close seasons, without avail. Then it was given ten-year close seasons, but it was <i> too late</i>!
</p>
<p>
To-day, the species exists only in one locality, the island of
Martha's Vineyard, and concerning its present status, Mr. Forbush
has recently furnished us the following clear statement:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
"The heath hens increased for two years after the Massachusetts Fish
and Game Commission established a reservation for them, but in 1911
they had not increased. There are probably about two hundred birds
extant.
	</p>
	<p>
"I found a great many marsh hawks on the Island and the Commission
did not kill them, believing them to be beneficial. In watching
them, I concluded that they were catching the young heath hens. A
large number of these hawks have been shot and their stomachs sent
to Washington for examination, as I was too busy at the time to
examine them. So far as I know, no report of the examination has
been made, but Dr. Field himself examined a few of the stomachs and
found the remains of the heath hen in some.
	</p>
	<p>
"The warden now says that during the past two years, the heath hen
has not increased, but I can give you no definite evidence of this.
I am quite sure they are being killed by natives of the island and
that at least one collector supplies birds for museums. We are
trying to get evidence of this.
	</p>
	<p>
I believe if the heath hen is to be increased in numbers and brought
back to this country, we shall have to have more than one warden on
the reservation and, eventually, we shall have to establish the bird
on the mainland also."

If the present open seasons prevail in the states that I have
mentioned above, no power on earth can save those three species of
grouse from the fate of the heath hen. To-day their representatives
exist only in small shreds and patches, and from fully
nineteen-twentieths of their original ranges they are forever gone.
</p>
<p>
The sage grouse will be the first species to go. It is the largest,
the most conspicuous, the one most easily found, and the biggest
mark for the gunner. Those who have seen this bird in its native
sage-brush well understand how fatally it is exposed to slaughter.
</p>
<p>
Many appeals have been made in behalf of the pinnated grouse; but
the open seasons continue. The gunners of the states in which a few
remnants still exist are determined to have them, all; and the state
legislatures seem disposed to allow the killers to have their way.
It may be <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page26] </span> </a> however, that like New York with the heath
hen, they will arouse and virtuously lock the stable
door&mdash;after the horse has been stolen!

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Snowy Egret And American Egret, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Egretta candidissima and Herodias egretta</i>). </span> &mdash;These unfortunate birds, cursed for all time by the commercially valuable "aigrette" plumes that they bear, have had a very narrow escape from total extinction in the United States, despite all the efforts made to save them. The "plume-hunters" of the millinery trade have been, <i> and still are</i>, determined to have the last feather and the last drop of egret blood. In an effort to stop the slaughter in at least one locality in Florida, Warden Guy Bradley was killed by a plume-hunter, who of course escaped all punishment through the heaven-born "sympathy" of a local jury.
</p>
<p>
Of the bloody egret slaughter in Florida, not one-tenth of the whole
story ever has been told. Millions of adult birds,&mdash;all there
were,&mdash;were killed <i> in the breeding season</i>, when the
plumes were ripe for the market; and millions of young birds starved
in their nests. It was a common thing for a rookery of several
hundred birds to be attacked by the plume-hunters, and in two or
three days utterly destroyed. The same bloody work is going on
to-day in Venezuela and Brazil; and the stories and "affidavits"
stating that the millions of egret plumes being shipped annually
from those countries are "shed feathers," "picked up off the
ground," are absolute lies. The men who have sworn to those lies are
perjurers, and should be punished for their crimes. (See <a
href="#CHAPTER_XIII"> Chapter XIII</a>).
</p>
<p>
By 1908, the plume-hunters had so far won the fight for the egrets
that Florida had been swept almost as bare of these birds as the
Colorado desert.
</p>
<p class="clearall">
	Until Mr. E.A. McIlhenny's egret preserve, at Avery Island, Louisiana, became a pronounced success, we had believed that our two egrets soon would become totally extinct in the United States. But Mr. McIlhenny has certainly saved those birds to our fauna. In 1892 he started an egret and heron preserve, close beside his house on Avery Island. By 1900 it was an established success. To-day 20,000 pairs of egrets and herons are living and breeding in that bird refuge, and the two egret species are safe in at least one spot in our own country.

<p>
Three years ago, I think there were not many bird-lovers in the
United States, who believed it possible to prevent the total
extinction of both egrets from our fauna. All the known rookeries
accessible to plume-hunters had been totally destroyed. Two years
ago, the secret discovery of several small, hidden colonies prompted
William Dutcher, President of the National Association of Audubon
Societies, and Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson, Secretary, to attempt the
protection of those colonies. With a fund contributed for the
purpose, wardens were hired and duly commissioned. As previously
stated, one of those wardens was shot dead in cold blood by a plume
hunter. The task of guarding swamp rookeries from the attacks of
money-hungry desperadoes to whom the accursed plumes were worth
their weight in gold, is a very chancy proceeding. There is now one
warden in Florida who says that "before they get my rookery they
will first have to get me."
</p>
<p>
Thus far the protective work of the Audubon Association has been
successful. Now there are twenty colonies, which contain all told,
about 5,000 egrets and about 120,000 herons and ibises which are
guarded by the Audubon wardens. One of the most important is on Bird
Island, a mile out in Orange Lake, central Florida, and it is ably
defended by Oscar E. Baynard. To-day, the plume hunters who do not
dare to raid the guarded rookeries are trying to study out the lines
of flight of the birds, to and from their feeding-grounds, and shoot
them in transit. Their motto is&mdash;"Anything to beat the law, and
get the plumes." It is there that the state of Florida should take
part in the war.
</p>
<p>
The success of this campaign is attested by the fact that last year
a number of egrets were seen in eastern Massachusetts&mdash;for the
first time in many years. And so to-day the question is, can the
wardens continue to hold the plume-hunters at bay?

To their everlasting honor, eight states responded, by the enactment of long close-season laws. This, is the

The above are the states that really possess the wood-duck and that
should give it, one and all, a series of five-year close seasons.
Now, is not the record something to blush for?
</p>
<p>
Is there in those fifteen states <i> nothing </i> too beautiful or
too good to go into the pot?
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page30] </span> </a>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Woodcock </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Philohela minor</i>), </span> is a bird regarding which my bird-hunting friends and I do not agree. I say that as a species it is steadily disappearing, and presently will become extinct, unless it is accorded better protection. They reply: "Well, I can show you where there are woodcock yet!"
</p>
<p>
A few months ago a Nova Scotian writer in <i> Forest and Stream </i>
came out with the bold prediction that three more years of the usual
annual slaughter of woodcock will bring the species to the verge of
extinction in that Province.
</p>
<p>
It is such occurrences as this that bring the end of a species:
</p>
<p>
"Last fall [1911, at Norwalk, Conn.] we had a good flight of
woodcock, and it is a shame the way they were slaughtered. I know of
a number of cases where twenty were killed by one gun in the day,
and heard of one case of fifty. This is all wrong, and means the end
of the woodcock, if continued. There is no doubt we need a bag limit
on woodcock, as much as on quail or partridge." ("Woodcock" in <i>
Forest and Stream</i>, Mar. 2, 1912.)
</p>
<p>
As far back as 1901, Dr. A.K. Fisher of the Biological Survey
predicted that the woodcock and wood-duck would both become extinct
unless better protected. As yet, the better protection demanded has
not materialized to any great extent.
</p>
<p>
Says Mr. Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, in his
admirable "Special Report," p. 45:
</p>
<p>
"The woodcock is decreasing all over its range in the East, and
needs the strongest protection. Of thirty-eight Massachusetts
reports, thirty-six state that "woodcock are decreasing," "rare" or
"extinct," while one states that they are holding their own, and one
that they are increasing slightly since the law was passed
prohibiting their sale."
</p>
<p>
Let not any honest American or Canadian sportsman lullaby himself
into the belief that the woodcock is safe from extermination. As
sure as the world, it is <i> going</i>! The fact that a little
pocket here or there contains a few birds does not in the slightest
degree disprove the main fact. If the sportsmen of this country
desire to save the seed stock of woodcock, they must give it <i>
everywhere </i> five or ten-year close seasons, and <i> do it
immediately</i>!
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Our Shore Birds In General. </span> &mdash;This group of game birds will be the first to be exterminated in North America as a <i> group</i>. Of all our birds, these are the most illy fitted to survive. They are very conspicuous, very unwary, easy to find if alive, and easy to shoot. Never in my life have any shore birds except woodcock and snipe appealed to me as real game. They are too easy to kill, too trivial when killed, and some of them are too rank and fishy on the plate. As game for men I place them on a level with barnyard ducks or orchard turkeys. I would as soon be caught stealing a sheep as to be seen trying to shoot fishy yellow legs or little joke sandpipers for the purpose of feeding upon them. And yet, thousands of full-grown men, some of them six feet high, grow indignant <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page31] </span> </a> and turn red in the face at the mention of a law to give all the shore-birds of New York a five-year close season.
</p>
<p>
But for all that, gentlemen of the gun, there are exactly two
alternatives between which you shall choose:
</p>
<p>
(1) Either give the woodcock of the eastern United States just <i>
ten times </i> the protection that it now has, or (2) bid the
species a long farewell. If you elect to slaughter old <i> Philohela
minor </i> on the altar of Selfishness, then it will be in order for
the millions of people who do not kill birds to say whether that
proposal shall be consummated or not.
</p>
<p>
Read if you please Mr. W.A. McAtee's convincing pamphlet (Biological
Survey, No. 79), on "Our Vanishing Shore Birds," reproduced in full
in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII"> Chapter XXIII</a>. He says: "Throughout
the eastern United States, shore birds are fast vanishing. Many of
them have been so reduced that <i> extermination seems imminent</i>.
So averse to shore birds are present conditions [of slaughter] that
the wonder is that any escape. All the shore birds of the United
States are in great need of better protection.... Shore birds have
been hunted until only a remnant of their once vast numbers are
left. Their limited powers of reproduction, coupled with the natural
vicissitudes of the breeding period, make their increase slow, and
peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination. So great is their
economic value that their retention in the game list and their
destruction by sportsmen is a serious loss to agriculture."
</p>
<p>
And yet, here in New York state there are many men who think they
"know," who indignantly scoff at the idea that our shore birds need
a five-year close season to help save them from annihilation. The
writer's appeal for this at a recent convention of the New York
State Fish, Game and Forest League fell upon deaf ears, and was not
even seriously discussed.
</p>
<p>
The shore-birds must be saved; and just at present it seems that the
only persons who will do it are those who are <i> not </i>
sportsmen, and who never kill game! If the sportsmen persist in
refusing to act, to them we must appeal.
</p>
<p>
Besides the woodcock and snipe, the species that are most seriously
threatened with extinction at an early date are the following:

<p>
Of these fine species, Mr. Forbush, whose excellent knowledge of the
shore birds of the Atlantic coast is well worth the most serious
consideration, says that the upland plover, or Bartramian sandpiper,
"is <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page32]
</span> </a> in imminent danger of extinction. Five reports from
localities where this bird formerly bred give it as nearing
extinction, and four as extinct. This is one of the most useful of
all birds in grass land, feeding largely on grasshoppers and
cutworms.... There is no difference of opinion in regard to the
diminution of the shore birds; the reports from all quarters are the
same. It is noteworthy that practically all observers agree that,
considering all species, these birds have fallen off about 75 per
cent within twenty-five to forty years, and that several species are
nearly extirpated."
</p>
<p>
In 1897 when the Zoological Society published my report on the
"Extermination of Our Birds and Mammals," we put down the decrease
in the volume of bird life in Massachusetts during the previous
fifteen years at twenty-seven per cent. The later and more elaborate
investigations of Mr. Forbush have satisfactorily vindicated the
accuracy of that estimate.
</p>
<p>
There are other North American birds that easily might be added to
the list of those now on the road to oblivion; but surely the
foregoing citations are sufficient to reveal the present desperate
conditions of our bird life in general. Now the question is: What
are the great American people going to do about it?

	THE GRAY SQUIRREL, A FAMILIAR FRIEND WHEN PROTECTED
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Gray Squirrel. </span> &mdash;The gray squirrel is in danger of extermination. Although it is our most beautiful and companionable small wild animal, and really unfit for food, Americans have strangely elected to class it <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page33] </span> </a> as "game," and shoot it to death, <i> to eat</i>! And this in stall-fed America, in the twentieth century! Americans are the only white people in the world who eat squirrels. It would be just as reasonable, and no more barbarous, to kill domestic cats and eat them. Their flesh would taste quite as good as squirrel flesh and some of them would afford quite as good "sport."
</p>
<p>
Every intelligent person knows that in the United States the deadly
shot-gun is rapidly exterminating every bird and every small mammal
that is classed as "game," and which legally may be killed, even
during two months of the twelve. The market gunners slaughter ducks,
grouse, shore birds and rabbits as if we were all starving.
</p>
<p>
The beautiful gray squirrel has clung to life in a few of our
forests and wood-lots, long after most other wild mammals have
disappeared; but throughout at least ninety-five per cent, of its
original area, it is now extinct. During the past thirty years I
have roamed the woods of my state in several widely separated
localities,&mdash;the Adirondacks, Catskills, Berkshires, western
New York and elsewhere, and in all that time I have seen only <i>
three </i> wild gray squirrels outside of city parks.
</p>
<p>
Except over a very small total area, the gray squirrel is already
gone from the wild fauna of New York State!
</p>
<p>
Do the well-fed people of America wish to have this beautiful animal
entirely exterminated? Do they wish the woods to become wholly
lifeless? Or, do they desire to bring back some of the wild
creatures, and keep them for their children to enjoy?
</p>
<p>
There is no wild mammal that responds to protection more quickly
than the gray squirrel. In two years' time, wild specimens that are
set free in city parks learn that they are safe from harm and become
almost fearless. They take food from the hands of visitors, and
climb into their arms. One of the most pleasing sights of the
Zoological Park is the enjoyment of visitors, young and old, in
"petting" our wild gray squirrels.
</p>
<p>
We ask the Boy Scouts of America to bring back this animal to each
state where it belongs, by securing for it from legislatures and
governors the perpetual closed seasons that it imperatively needs.
It is not much to ask. This can be done by writing to members of the
legislatures and requesting a suitable law. Such a request will be
both right and reasonable; and three states have already granted it.
</p>
<p>
The gray squirrel is naturally the children's closest wild-animal
friend. Surely every farmer boy would like to have colonies of gray
squirrels around him, to keep him company, and furnish him with
entertainment. A wood-lot without squirrels and chipmunks is indeed
a lifeless place. For $20 anyone can restock any bit of woods with
the most companionable and most beautiful tree-dweller that nature
has given us.
</p>
<p>
The question now is, which will you choose&mdash;a gray squirrel
colony to every farm, or lifeless desolation?
</p>
<p>
We ask every American to lend a hand to save Silver-Tail.

<p>
When we pause and consider the years, the generations and the ages
that Nature spends in the production of a high vertebrate species,
the preservation of such species from extermination should seriously
concern us. As a matter of fact, in modern man's wild chase after
wealth and pleasure, it is only one person out of every ten thousand
who pauses to regard such causes, unless cornered by some
protectionist fanatic, held fast and coerced to listen.
</p>
<p>
We are not discussing the animals of the Pleistocene, or the Eocene,
or any period of the far-distant Past. We are dealing with species
that have been ruthlessly, needlessly and wickedly destroyed by man
during our own times; species that, had they been given a fair
chance, would be alive and well to-day.
</p>
<p>
In reckless waste of blood and treasure, the nineteenth century has
much for which to answer. Wars and pillage, fires, earthquakes and
volcanoes are unhappily unavoidable. Like the poor of holy writ, we
have them with us always. But the destruction of animal life is in a
totally different category from the accidental calamities of life.
It is deliberate, cold-blooded, persistent, and in its final stage,
<i> criminal</i>! Worst of all, there is no limit to the devilish
persistence of the confirmed destroyer, this side of the total
extinction of species. No polar night is too cold, no desert inferno
is too hot for the man who pursues wild life for commercial
purposes. The rhytina has been exterminated in the far north, the
elephant seals on Kerguelen are being exterminated in the far south,
and midway, in the desert mountains of Lower California a fine
species of mountain sheep is rapidly being shot into oblivion.
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<div class="centerheading">
	Large Mammals Completely Exterminated
</div>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Arizona Elk, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Cervus merriami</i>). </span> &mdash;Right at our very door, under our very noses and as it were only yesterday, a well-defined species of American elk has been totally exterminated. Until recently the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico were inhabited by a light-colored elk of smaller size than the Wyoming species, whose antlers possessed on each side only one brow tine instead of two. The exact history of the blotting out of that species has not yet been written, but it seems that its final extinction occurred about 1901. Its extermination was only a routine incident of the devilish general slaughter of American big game that by 1900 had wiped out nearly everything killable over a large portion of the Rocky Mountain region and the Great Plains.
</p>
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page35] </span> </a>
<p>
The Arizona elk was exterminated before the separate standing of the
species had been discovered by naturalists, and before even <i> one
</i> skin had been preserved in a museum! In 1902 Mr. E.W. Nelson
described the species from two male skulls, all the material of
which he knew. Since that time, a third male skull, bearing an
excellent pair of antlers, has been discovered by Mr. Ferdinand
Kaegebehn, a member of the New York Zoological Society, and
presented to our National Collection of Heads and Horns. It came
from the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, in 1884. The species was
first exterminated in the central and northern mountains of Arizona,
probably twenty years ago, and made its last stand in northwestern
New Mexico. Precisely when it became extinct there, its last abiding
place, we do not know, but in time the facts may appear.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Quagga, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Equus quagga</i>). </span> &mdash;Before the days of Livingstone, Gordon-Cumming and Anderson, the grassy plains and half-forested hills of South Africa were inhabited by great herds of a wild equine species that in its markings was a sort of connecting link between the striped zebras and the stripeless wild asses. The quagga resembled a wild ass with a few zebra stripes around its neck, and no stripes elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
There is no good reason why a mammal that is not in any one of the
families regularly eaten by man should be classed as a game animal.
White men, outside of the western border of the continent of Europe,
do not eat horses; and by this token there is no reason why a zebra
should be shot as a "game" animal, any more than a baboon. A big
male baboon is dangerous; a male zebra is not.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, white men have elected to shoot zebras as game; and
under this curse the unfortunate quagga fell to rise no more. The
species was shot to a speedy death by sportsmen, and by the British
and Dutch farmers of South Africa. It became extinct about 1875, and
to-day there are only 18 specimens in all the museums of the world.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Blaubok, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Hippotragus leucophaeus</i>). </span> &mdash;The first of the African antelopes to become extinct in modern times was a species of large size, closely related to the roan antelope of to-day, and named by the early Dutch settlers of Cape Colony the blaubok, which means "blue-buck." It was snuffed out of existence in the year 1800, so quickly and so thoroughly that, like the Arizona elk, it very nearly escaped the annals of natural history. According to the careful investigations of Mr. Graham Renshaw, there are only eight specimens in existence in all the museums of Europe. In general terms it may be stated that this species has been extinct for about a century.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> David's Deer </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Elaphurus davidianus</i>). </span> &mdash;We enter this species with those that are totally extinct, because this is true of it so far as its wild state is concerned. It is a deer nearly as large as the red deer of Europe, with 3-tined antlers about equal in total length to those of the red deer. Its most striking differential character is its <i> long tail</i>, a feature that among the deer of the world is quite unique.
</p>
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page36] </span> </a>
<p>
Originally this species inhabited "northern Mongolia" (China), but
in a wild state it became extinct before its zoological standing
became known to the scientific world. The species was called to the
attention of zoologists by a Roman Catholic missionary, called
Father David, and when finally described it was named in his honor.
</p>
<p>
At the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion, in 1900, there were about
200 specimens living in the imperial park of China, a short distance
south of Pekin; but during the rebellion, all of them were killed
and eaten, thus totally exterminating the species from Asia.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, previous to that calamity (in 1894), the Duke of
Bedford had by considerable effort and expenditure procured and
established in his matchless park surrounding Woburn Abbey, England,
a herd of eighteen specimens of this rarest of all deer. That
nucleus has thriven and increased, until in 1910 it contained
thirty-four head. Owing to the fact that all the living female
specimens of this remarkable species are concentrated in one spot,
and perfectly liable to be wiped out in one year by riot, war or
disease, there is some cause for anxiety. The writer has gone so far
as to suggest the desirability of starting a new herd of David's
deer, at some point far distant from England, as an insurance
measure against the possibility of calamity at Woburn. Excepting two
or three specimens in European zoological gardens that have been
favored by the Duke of Bedford, there are no living specimens
outside of Woburn Park.

It was first made known to the world by Steller, in 1741, and must have become extinct near the beginning of the nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>
The rhytina belonged to the same mammalian Order as the manatee of
Florida and South America, and the dugong of Australia. The largest
manatee that Florida has produced, so far as we know, was thirteen
feet long. The rhytina attained a length of between thirty and
thirty-five feet, and a weight of 6,000 pounds or over. The flesh of
this animal, like that of the manatee and dugong, must have been
edible, and surely was prized by the hungry sailors and natives of
its time. It is not <a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page37] </span> </a> strange that such a species
was quickly exterminated by man, in the arctic regions. The wonder

an animal which by all precedents should prefer life in temperate or
warm waters.

While there are Chapman zebras and Grant zebras in plenty, and of
Crawshay's not a few, all these are forms that have developed
northward of the range of the parent species, the original <i> Equus
burchelli</i>. For half a century in South Africa the latter had
been harried and driven and shot, and now it is gone, forever. Now,
the museum people of the world are hungrily enumerating their

	<span class="title"> The Thylacine Or Tasmanian Wolf, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Thylacinus cynocephalus</i>). </span> &mdash; Four years ago, when Mr. W.H.D. Le Souef, Director of the Melbourne Zoological Garden (Australia), stood before the cage of the living thylacine in the New York Zoological Park, he first expressed surprise at the sight of the animal, then said:
</p>
<p>
"I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen; for when it
is gone, you never will get another. The species soon will be
extinct."
</p>
<p>
This opinion has been supported, quite independently, by a lady who
is the highest authority on the present status of that species, Mrs.
Mary G. Roberts, of Hobart, Tasmania. For nearly ten years Mrs.
Roberts has been procuring all the living specimens of the thylacine
that money could buy, and attempting to breed them at her private
zoo. She states that the mountain home of this animal is now
occupied by flocks of sheep, and because of the fact that the
"Tasmanian wolves" raid the flocks and kill lambs, the sheep-owners
and herders are systematically poisoning the thylacines as fast as
possible. Inasmuch as the species is limited to <a name="Page_39"
id="Page_39"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page39] </span> </a>
Tasmania, Mrs. Roberts and others fear that the sheepmen will
totally exterminate the remnant at an early date. This animal is the
largest and also the most interesting carnivorous marsupial of
Australia, and its untimely end will be a cause for sincere regret.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The West Indian Seal, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Monachus tropicalis</i>). </span> &mdash;For at least fifty years, all the zoologists who ever had heard of this species believed that the oil-hunters had completely exterminated it. In 1885, when the National Museum came into possession of one poorly-mounted skin, from Professor Poey, of Havana, it was regarded as a great <i> prize</i>.
</p>
<p>
Most unexpectedly, in 1886 American zoologists were startled by the
discovery of a small herd on the Triangle Islands, in the Caribbean
Sea, near Yucatan, by Mr. Henry L. Ward, now director of the
Milwaukee Public Museum, and Professor Ferrari, of the National
Museum of Mexico. They found about twenty specimens, and collected
only a sufficient number to establish the true character of the
species.
</p>
<p>
Since that time, four living specimens have been captured, and sent
to the New York Aquarium, where they lived for satisfactory periods.
The indoor life and atmosphere did not seem to injure the natural
vitality of the animals. In fact, I think they were far more lively
in the Aquarium than were the sluggish creatures that Mr. Ward saw
on the Triangle reefs, and described in his report of the
expedition.
</p>
<p>
It is quite possible that there are yet alive a few specimens of
this odd species; but the Damocletian sword of destruction hangs
over them suspended by a fine hair, and it is to be expected that in
the future <a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page40] </span> </a> some roving sea adventurer will pounce upon
the Remnant, and wipe it out of existence for whatever reason may to
him seem good.

	CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEAL
</p>
<p class="captionsubheading">
	Photographed on Guadalupe Island by C.H. Townsend.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The California Elephant Seal, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Mirounga angustirostris</i>). </span> &mdash;This remarkable long-snouted species of seal was reluctantly stricken from the fauna of the United States several years ago, and for at least fifteen years it has been regarded as totally extinct. Last year, however (1911), the <i> Albatross </i> scientific expedition, under the control of Director C.H. Townsend of the New York Aquarium, visited Guadalupe Island, 175 miles off the Pacific coast of Lower California and there found about 150 living elephant seals. They took six living specimens, all of which died after a few months in captivity. Ever since that time, first one person and then another comes to the front with a cheerful proposition to go to those islands and "clean up" all the remainder of those wonderful seals. One hunting party could land on Guadalupe, and in one week totally destroy the last remnant of this almost extinct species. To-day the only question is, Who will be mean enough to do it?
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, those seals have no commercial value whatsoever. The
little oil they would yield would not pay the wages of cook's mate.
The proven impossibility of keeping specimens alive in captivity,
even for one year, and the absence of cash value in the skins, even
for museum purposes, has left nothing of value in the animals to
justify an expedition to kill or to capture them. No zoological
garden or park desires any of them, at any price. Adult males attain
a length of sixteen feet, and females eleven feet. Formerly this
species was abundant in San Christobal Bay, Lower California.
</p>
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page41] </span> </a>
<p>
At present, Mexico is in no frame of mind to provide real protection
to a small colony of seals of no commercial value, 175 miles from
her mainland, on an uninhabited island. It is wildly improbable that
those seals will be permitted to live. It is a safe prediction that
our next news of the elephant seals of Guadalupe will tell of the
total extinction of those last 140 survivors of the species.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The California Grizzly Bear, </span> <span class="latin"> (<i>Ursus horribilis californicus</i>). </span> &mdash;No one protects grizzly bears, except in the Yellowstone Park and other game preserves. For obvious reasons, it is impossible to say whether any individuals of this huge species now remain alive, or how long it will be until the last one falls before a .405 Winchester engine of extermination. We know that a living specimen can not be procured with money, and we believe that "Old Monarch" now in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, is the last specimen of his species that ever will be exhibited alive.
</p>
<p>
I can think of no reason, save general Californian apathy, why the
extinction of this huge and remarkable animal was not prevented by
law. The sunset grizzly (on a railroad track) is the advertising
emblem of the Golden State, and surely the state should take
sufficient interest in the species to prevent its total
extermination.
</p>
<p>
But it will not. California is hell-bent on exterminating a long
list of her wild-life species, and it is very doubtful whether the
masses can be reached and aroused in time to stop it. Name some of
the species? Certainly; with all the pleasure in life: The
band-tailed pigeon, the white-tailed kite, the sharp-tailed grouse,
the sage grouse, the mountain sheep, prong-horned antelope,
California mule deer, and ducks and geese too numerous to mention.

	<div class="subtitle">
		THE EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES, STATE BY STATE
	</div>
</div>
<p>
Early in 1912 I addressed to about 250 persons throughout the United
States, three questions, as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		What species of birds have become totally extinct in your state?
	</li>
	<li>
		What species of birds and mammals are threatened with early extinction?
	</li>
	<li>
		What species of mammals have been exterminated throughout your state?
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
These queries were addressed to persons whose tastes and
observations rendered them especially qualified to furnish the
information desired. The interest shown in the inquiry was highly
gratifying. The best of the information given is summarized below;
but this tabulation also includes much information acquired from
other sources. The general summary of the subject will, I am sure,
convince all thoughtful persons that the present condition of the
best wild life of the nation is indeed very grave. This list is not
submitted as representing prolonged research or absolute perfection,
but it is sufficient to point forty-eight morals.

	Birds And Mammals Threatened With Extinction
</div>
<p>
The second question submitted in my inquiry produced results even
more startling than the first. None of the persons reporting can be
regarded as alarmists, but some of the lists of species approaching
extinction are appallingly long. To their observations I add other
notes and observations of interest at this time.
</p>
<div class="statelist">
	<span class="name"> Alabama: </span>
	<p>
Wood-duck, snowy egret, woodcock. "The worst enemy of wild life is
the pot-hunter and game hog. These wholesale slaughterers of game
resort to any device and practice, it matters not how murderous, to
accomplish the pernicious ends of their nefarious campaign of
relentless extermination of fur and feather. They cannot be
controlled by local laws, for these after having been tried for
several generations have proven consummate failures, for the reason
that local authorities will not enforce the provisions of game and
bird protective statutes. Experience has demonstrated the fact that
no one desires to inform voluntarily on his neighbors, and since
breaking the game law is not construed to involve moral turpitude,
even to an infinitesimal degree, by many of our citizens, the
plunderers of nature's storehouse thus go free, it matters not how
great the damage done to the people as a whole."&mdash;(John H.
Wallace, Jr., Game Commissioner of Alabama.)
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Alaska: </span>
	<p>
Thanks to geographic and climatic conditions, the Alaskan game laws
and $15,000 with which to enforce them, the status of the wild life
of Alaska is fairly satisfactory. I think that at present no species
is in danger of extinction in the near future. When it was pointed
out to Congress in 1902, by Madison Grant, T.S. Palmer and others
that the wild life of Alaska was seriously threatened, Congress
immediately enacted the law that was recommended, and now
appropriates yearly a fair sum for its enforcement. I regard the
Alaskan situation as being, for so vast and difficult a region,
reasonably well in hand, even though open to improvement.
	</p>
	<p>
There is one fatal defect in our Alaskan game law, in the perpetual
and sweeping license to kill, that is bestowed upon "natives" and
"prospectors." Under cover of this law, the Indians can slaughter
game to any extent they choose; and they are great killers. For
example: In 1911 at Sand Point, Kenai Peninsula, Frank E.
Kleinchmidt saw 82 caribou tongues in the boat of a native, that had
been brought in for sale at 50 cents, while the carcasses were left
where they fell, to poison the air of Alaska. Thanks to the game
law, and five wardens, the number of big game animals killed last
year in Alaska by sportsmen was reasonably small,&mdash;just as it
should have been.&mdash;(W.T.H.)

shortly, they will be found hereafter only in remote districts.
Ducks also are decreasing rapidly.&mdash;(H.W. Keller, Los Angeles.)

Harlequin duck, mountain plover, dusky grouse, Columbian

Pinnated grouse, except where rigidly protected. In Vermillion
County, by long and persistent protection Harvey J. Sconce has bred
back upon his farm about 400 of these birds.

	<p>
Pileated woodpecker, woodcock, ruffed grouse, pigeon hawk, duck
hawk.&mdash;(Amos W. Butler, Indianapolis.)
	</p>
	<p>
In northern and northwestern Indiana, a perpetual close season and
rigid protection have enabled the almost-extinct pinnated grouse to
breed up to a total number now estimated by Game Commissioner Miles
and his wardens at 10,000 birds. This is a gratifying illustration
of what can be done in bringing back an almost-vanished species. The
good example of Indiana should be followed by every state that still
possesses a remnant of prairie-chickens, or other grouse.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Iowa: </span>
	<p>
Pinnated grouse, wood-duck. Notwithstanding an invasion of Jasper
County, Iowa, in the winter of 1911-12 by hundreds of pinnated
grouse, such as had not been known in 20 years, this gives no ground
to hope that the future of the species is worth a moment's purchase.
The winter migration came from the Dakotas, and was believed to be
due to the extra severe winter, and the scarcity of food. Commenting
on this unprecedented occurrence, J.L. Sloanaker in the "Wilson
Bulletin" No. 78, says:
	</p>
	<p>
"In the opinion of many, the formerly abundant prairie chicken is
doomed to early extinction. Many will testify to their abundance in
those years [in South Dakota, 1902] when the great land movement was
taking place. The influx of hungry settlers, <a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page48] </span> </a> together
with an occasional bad season, decimated their ranks. They were
eaten by the farmers, both in and out of season. Driven from pillar
to post, with no friends and insufficient food,&mdash;what else then
can be expected?"
	</p>
	<p>
Mr. F.C. Pellett, of Atlantic, Iowa, says: "Unless ways can be
devised of rearing these birds in the domestic state, the prairie
hen in my opinion is doomed to early extinction."
	</p>
	<p>
The older inhabitants here say that there is not one song-bird in
summer where there used to be ten.&mdash;(G.H. Nicol, in <i> Outdoor
Life </i> March, 1912.)

	<p>
To all of those named in my previous list that are not actually
extinct, I might add the prairie hen, the lesser prairie hen, as
well as the prairie sharp-tailed grouse and the wood-duck. Such
water birds as the avocets, godwits, greater yellow-legs,
long-billed curlew and Eskimo curlew are becoming very rare. All the
water birds that are killed as game birds have been greatly reduced
in numbers during the past 25 years. I have not seen a wood-duck in
5 years. <i> The prairie chicken </i> has entirely disappeared from
this locality. A few are still seen in the sand hills of western
Kansas, and they are still comparatively abundant along the extreme
southwestern line, and in northern Oklahoma and the Texas
panhandle.&mdash;(C.H. Smyth, Wichita.)

	<p>
Curlew, pileated woodpecker, summer duck, snowy heron. No record of
sandhill crane for the last 35 years. Greater yellow-leg is much
scarcer than formerly, also Bartramian sandpiper. The only two birds
which show an <i> increase </i> in the past few years are the robin
and lesser scaup. General protection of the robin has caused its
increase; stopping of spring shooting in the North has probably
caused the increase of the latter. As a general proposition I think
I can say that all birds are becoming scarcer in this state, as we
have laws that do not protect, little enforcement of same, no
revenue for bird protection and too little public interest. We are
working to change all this, but it comes slowly. <i> The public
fails to respond until the birds are 'most gone</i>, and we have a
pretty good lot of game still left. The members of the Order
Gallinae are only holding their own where privately protected. The
members of the Plover Family and what are known locally as shore
birds are still plentiful on the shores of Chincoteague and
Assateague, and although they do not breed there as formerly, so far
as I know there are no species exterminated.&mdash;(Talbott Denmead,

Wood-duck, hooded merganser, blue-winged teal, upland plover; curlew
(perhaps already gone); red-tailed hawk (I have not seen one in
Middlesex County for several years); great horned owl (almost gone
in my county, Middlesex); house wren. The eave swallows and purple
martins are fast deserting eastern Massachusetts and the barn

perhaps be included here. I seldom see or hear of it

Wood-duck, limicolae, woodcock, sandhill crane. The great whooping

Mershon, Saginaw.)
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Minnesota: </span>
	<p>
The sandhill crane has been killed by sportsmen. I have not seen one
in three years. Where there were, a few years ago, thousands of blue
herons, egrets, wood ducks, redbirds, and Baltimore orioles, all
those birds are now almost extinct in this state. They are being
killed by Austrians and Italians, who slaughter everything that
flies or moves. Robins, too, will be a rarity if more severe
penalties are not imposed. I have seized 22 robins, 1 pigeon hawk, 1
crested log-cock, 4 woodpeckers and 1 grosbeak in one camp, at the
Lertonia mine, all being prepared for eating. I have also caught
them preparing and eating sea gulls, terns, blue heron, egret and
even the bittern. I have secured 128 convictions since the first of
last September.&mdash;(George E. Wood, Game Warden, Hibbing,
Minnesota.)
	</p>
	<p>
From Robert Page Lincoln, Minneapolis.&mdash;Partridge are waning
fast, quail gradually becoming extinct, prairie chickens almost
extinct. Duck-shooting is rare. The gray squirrel is fast becoming
extinct in Minnesota. Mink are going fast, and fur-bearing animals
generally are becoming extinct. The game is passing so very rapidly
that it will soon be a thing of the forgotten past. The quail are
suffering most. The falling off is amazing, and inconceivable to one
who has not looked it up. Duck-shooting is rare, the clubs are idle
for want of birds. What ducks come down fly high, being harassed
coming down from the north. I consider the southern Minnesota
country practically cleaned out.

Sage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are becoming extinct, both in

have sage grouse protected until 1915. The miners (mostly
foreigners) are out after rabbits at all seasons. To them everything
that flies, walks or swims, large enough to be seen, is a "rabbit."
They are even worse than the average sheep-herder, as he will seldom
kill a bird brooding her young, but to one of those men, a wren or
creeper looks like a turkey. Antelope, mountain sheep and grizzly
bears are <i> going</i>, fast! The moose season opens in 1915, for a

In closing the notes of this survey, I repeat my assurance that they
are not offered on a basis of infallibility. It would require years
of work to obtain answers from forty-eight states to the three
questions that I have asked that could be offered as absolutely
exact. All these reports are submitted on the well-recognized
court-testimony basis,&mdash;"to the best of our knowledge and
belief." Gathered as they have been from persons whose knowledge is
good, these opinions are therefore valuable; and they furnish
excellent indices of wild-life conditions as they exist in 1912 in
the various states and provinces of North America north of Mexico.

		THE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTION

<p>
In order to cure any disease, the surgeon must make of it a correct
diagnosis. It is useless to try to prescribe remedies without a
thorough understanding of the trouble.
</p>
<p>
That the best and most interesting wild life of America is
disappearing at a rapid rate, we all know only too well. That
proposition is entirely beyond the domain of argument. The fact that
a species or a group of species has made a little gain here and
there, or is stationary, does not sensibly diminish the force of the
descending blow. The wild-life situation is full of surprises. For
example, in 1902 I was astounded by the extent to which bird life
had decreased over the 130 miles between Miles City, Montana, and
the Missouri River since 1886; for there was no reason to expect
anything of the kind. Even the jack rabbits and coyotes had almost
totally disappeared.
</p>
<p>
The duties of the present hour, that fairly thrust themselves into
our faces and will not be put aside, are these:
</p>
<p>
<i> First</i>,&mdash;To save valuable species from extermination!
</p>
<p>
<i> Second</i>,&mdash;To preserve a satisfactory representation of
our once rich fauna, to hand down to Posterity.
</p>
<p>
<i> Third</i>,&mdash;To protect the farmer and fruit grower from the
enormous losses that the destruction of our insectivorous and
rodent-eating birds is now inflicting upon both the producer and
consumer.
</p>
<p>
<i> Fourth</i>,&mdash;To protect our forests, by protecting the
birds that keep down the myriads of insects that are destructive to
trees and shrubs.
</p>
<p>
<i> Fifth</i>,&mdash;To preserve to the future sportsmen of America
enough game and fish that they may have at least a taste of the
legitimate pursuit of game in the open that has made life so
interesting to the sportsmen of to-day.
</p>
<p>
For any civilized nation to exterminate valuable and interesting
species of wild mammals, birds or fishes is more than a disgrace. It
is a crime! We have no right, legal, moral or commercial, to
exterminate any valuable or interesting species; because none of
them belong to us, to exterminate or not, as we please.
</p>
<p>
For the people of any civilized nation to permit the slaughter of
the wild birds that protect its crops, its fruits and its forests
from the insect hordes, is worse than folly. It is sheer orneryness
and idiocy. People who are either so lazy or asinine as to permit
the slaughter of their best <a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page54] </span> </a> friends deserve to have
their crops destroyed and their forests ravaged. They deserve to pay
twenty cents a pound for their cotton when the boll weevil has cut
down the normal supply.
</p>
<p>
It is very desirable that we should now take an inventory of the
forces that have been, and to-day are, active in the destruction of
our wild birds, mammals, and game fishes. During the past ten years
a sufficient quantity of facts and figures has become available to
enable us to secure a reasonably full and accurate view of the whole
situation. As we pause on our hill-top, and survey the field of
carnage, we find that we are reviewing the <i> Army of
Destruction</i>!
</p>
<p>
It is indeed a motley array. We see true sportsmen beside ordinary
gunners, game-hogs and meat hunters; handsome setter dogs are mixed
up with coyotes, cats, foxes and skunks; and well-gowned women and
ladies' maids are jostled by half-naked "poor-white" and black-negro
"plume hunters."
</p>
<p>
Verily, the destruction of wild life makes strange companions.
</p>
<p>
Let us briefly review the several army corps that together make up
the army of the destroyers. Space in this volume forbids an extended
notice of each. Unfortunately it is impossible to segregate some of
these classes, and number each one, for they merge together too
closely for that; but we can at least describe the several classes
that form the great mass of destroyers.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Gentlemen Sportsmen. </span> &mdash;These men are the very bone and sinew of wild life preservation. These are the men who have red blood in their veins, who annually hear the red gods calling, who love the earth, the mountains, the woods, the waters and the sky. These are the men to whom "the bag" is a matter of small importance, and to whom "the bag-limit" has only academic interest; because in nine cases out of ten they do not care to kill all that the law allows. The tenth and exceptional time is when the bag limit is "one." A gentleman sportsman is a man who protects game, stops shooting when he has "enough"&mdash;without reference to the legal bag-limit, and whenever a species is threatened with extinction, he conscientiously refrains from shooting it.
</p>
<p>
The true sportsmen of the world are the men who once were keen in
the stubble or on the trail, but who have been halted by the general
slaughter and the awful decrease of game. Many of them, long before
a hair has turned gray, have hung up their guns forever, and turned
to the camera. These are the men who are willing to hand out checks,
or to leave their mirth and their employment and go to the firing
line at their state capitols, to lock horns with the bull-headed
killers of wild life who recognize no check or limit save the law.
</p>
<p>
These are the men who have done the most to put upon our statute
books the laws that thus far have saved some of our American game
from total annihilation, and who (so we firmly believe) will be
chiefly instrumental in tightening the lines of protection around
the remnant. These are the men who are making and stocking game
preserves, public and private, great and small.

<p>
If you wish to know some of these men, I will tell you where to find
a goodly number of them; and when you find them, you will also find
that they are men you would enjoy camping with! Look in the
membership lists of the Boone and Crockett Club, Camp-Fire Club of
America, the Lewis and Clark Club of Pittsburgh, the New York State
League, the Shikar Club of London, the Society for the Preservation
of the Wild Fauna of the British Empire, the Massachusetts Fish and
Game Protective Association, the Springfield (Mass.) Sportsmen's
Association, the Camp-Fire Clubs of Detroit and Chicago, and the
North American Fish and Game Protective Association.
</p>
<p>
There are other bodies of sportsmen that I would like to name, were
space available, but to set down here a complete list is quite
impossible.
</p>
<p>
The best and the most of the game-protective laws now in force in
the United States and Canada were brought into existence through the
initiative and efforts of the real sportsmen of those two nations.
But for their activity, exerted on the right side, the settled
portion of North America would to-day be an utterly gameless land!
Even though the sportsmen have taken their toll of the wilds, they
have made the laws that have saved a remnant of the game until 1912.
</p>
<p>
For all that, however, every man who still shoots game is a soldier
in the Army of Destruction! There is no blinking that fact. Such men
do not stand on the summit with the men who now protect the game <i>
and do not shoot at all! </i> The millions of men who do not shoot,
and who also <i> do nothing to protect or preserve wild life</i>, do
not count! In this warfare they are merely ciphers in front of the
real figures.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Gunners, Who Kill To The Limit. </span> &mdash;Out of the enormous mass of men who annually take up arms against the remnant of wild life, <i> and are called "sportsmen</i>," I believe that only one out of every 500 <i> conscientiously </i> stops shooting when game becomes scarce, and extinction is impending. All of the others feel that it is right and proper to kill all the game that they can kill <i> up to the legal bag limit</i>. It is the reasoning of Shylock:
</p>
<p class="center">
	"Justice demands it, and <i> the law </i> doth give it!"
</p>
<p>
Especially is this true of the men who pay their <i> one dollar </i>
per year for a resident hunting license, and feel that in doing so
they have done a great Big Thing!
</p>
<p>
This is a very deadly frame of mind. Ethically it is <i> entirely
wrong</i>; and at least two million men and boys who shoot American
game must be shown that it is wrong! This is the spirit of
Extermination, clothed in the robes of Law and Justice.
</p>
<p>
Whenever and wherever game birds are so scarce that a good shot who
hunts hard during a day in the fields finds only three or four
birds, he should <i> stop shooting at once, and devote his mind and
energies to the problem of bringing back the game! </i> It is
strange that conditions do not make this duty clear to every
conscientious citizen.
</p>
<p>
The Shylock spirit which prompts a man to kill all that "the law
allows" is a terrible scourge to the wild life of America, and to
the world at <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page57] </span> </a> large. It is the spirit of extermination
according to law. Even the killing of game for the market is not so
great a scourge as this; for this spirit searches out the game in
every nook and cranny of the world, and spares not. In effect it
says: "If the law is defective, it is right for me to take every
advantage of it! I do not need to have any conscience in the matter
outside <i> the letter of the law</i>."
</p>
<p>
The extent to which this amazing spirit prevails is positively
awful. You will find it among pseudo game-protectors to a paralyzing
extent! It is the great gunner's paradox, and it pervades this
country from corner to corner. No: there is no use in trying to
"educate" the mass of the hunters of America out of it, as a means
of saving the game; for positively it can not be done! Do not waste
time in trying it. If you rely upon it, you will be doing a great
wrong to wild life, and promoting extermination. The only remedy is
<i> sweeping laws, for long close seasons, for a great many
species</i>. Forget the paltry dollar-a-year license money. The
license fees never represent more than a tenth part of the value of
the game that is killed under licenses.
</p>
<p>
The savage desire to kill "all that the law allows" often is
manifested in men in whom we naturally expect to find a very
different spirit. By way of illumination, I offer three cases out of
the many that I could state.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Case No. 1. </span> <span class="latin"> <i> The Duck Breeder</i>. </span> &mdash;A gentleman of my acquaintance has spent several years and much money in breeding wild ducks. From my relations with him, I had acquired the belief that he was a great lover of ducks, and at least wished all species well. One whizzing cold day in winter he called upon me, and stated that he had been duck-hunting; which surprised me. He added, "I have just spent two days on Great South Bay, and I made a great killing. <i> In the two days I got ninety-four ducks!" </i>
</p>
<p>
I said, "How <i> could </i> you do it,&mdash;caring for wild ducks
as you do?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, I had hunted ducks twice before on Great South Bay and didn't
have very good luck; but this time the cold weather drove the ducks
in, and I got square with them!"
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Case No. 2. </span> <span class="latin"> <i> The Ornithologist</i>. </span> &mdash;A short time ago the news was published in <i> Forest and Stream</i>, that a well-known ornithologist had distinguished himself in one of the mid-western states by the skill he had displayed in bagging thirty-four ducks in one day, greatly to the envy of the natives; and if this shoe fits any American naturalist, he is welcome to put it on and wear it.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Case No. 3. </span> <span class="latin"> <i> The Sportsman</i>. </span> &mdash;A friend of mine in the South is the owner of a game preserve in which wild ducks are at times very numerous. Once upon a time he was visited by a northern sportsmen who takes a deep and abiding interest in the preservation of game. The sportsman was invited to go out duck-shooting; ducks being then in season there. He said:

<p>
"Yes, I will go; and I want you to put me in a place where I can
kill a <i> hundred ducks in a day</i>! I never have done that yet,
and I would like to do it, once!"
</p>
<p>
"All right," said my friend, "I can put you in such a place; and if
you can shoot well enough, you can kill a hundred ducks in a day."
</p>
<p>
The effort was made in all earnestness. There was much shooting, but
few were the ducks that fell before it. In concluding this story my
friend remarked in a tone of disgust:
</p>
<p>
"All the game-preserving sportsmen that come to me are just like
that! <i> They want to kill all they can kill</i>!"
</p>
<p>
There is a blood-test by which to separate the conscientious
sportsmen from the mere gunners. Here it is:
</p>
<p>
A <i> sportsman </i> stops shooting when game becomes scarce; and he
does not object to long-close-season laws; but
</p>
<p>
A <i> gunner </i> believes in killing "all that the law allows;" and
<i> he objects to long close seasons</i>!
</p>
<p>
I warrant that whenever and wherever this test is applied it will
separate the sheep from the goats. It applies in all America, all
Asia and Africa, and in Greenland, with equal force.
</p>
<p class="clearall">
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Game-Hog. </span> &mdash;This term was coined by G.O. Shields, in 1897, when he was editor and owner of <i> Recreation Magazine</i>, and it has come into general use. It has been recognized by a judge on the bench as being an appropriate term to apply to all men who selfishly slaughter wild game beyond the limits of decency. Although it is a harsh term, and was mercilessly used by Mr. Shields in his fierce war on the men who slaughtered game for "sport," it has jarred at least a hundred thousand men into their first realization of the fact that to-day there is a difference between decency and indecency in the pursuit of game. The use of the term has done <i> very great good</i>; but, strange to say, it has made for Mr. Shields a great many enemies <i> outside </i> the ranks of the game-hogs themselves! From this one might fairly suppose that there is such a thing as a sympathetic game-hog!
</p>
<p>
One thing at least is certain. During a period of about six years,
while his war with the game-hogs was on, from Maine to California,
Mr. Shields's name became a genuine terror to excessive killers of
game; and it is reasonably certain that his war saved a great number
of game birds from the slaughter that otherwise would have overtaken
them!
</p>
<p>
The number of armed men and boys who annually take the field in the
United States in the pursuit of birds and quadrupeds, is enormous.
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page59]
</span> </a> People who do not shoot have no conception of it; and
neither do they comprehend the mechanical perfection and fearful
deadliness of the weapons used. This feature of the situation can
hardly be realized until some aspect of it is actually seen.
</p>
<p>
I have been at some pains to collect the latest figures showing the
number of hunting licenses issued in 1911, but the total is
incomplete. In some states the figures are not obtainable, and in
some states there are no hunters' license laws. The figures of
hunting licenses issued in 1911 that I have obtained from official
sources are set forth below.

<p>
The average for the twenty-seven states that issued licenses as
shown above is 55,046 for each state.
</p>
<p>
Now, the twenty-one states issuing no licenses, or not reporting,
produced in 1911 fully as many gunners per capita as did the other
twenty-seven states. Computed fairly on existing averages they must
have turned out a total of 1,155,966 gunners, making for all the
United States <b> 2,642,194 </b> armed men and boys warring upon the
remnant of game in 1911. We are not counting the large number of
lawless hunters who never take out licenses. Now, is Mr. Beard's
picture a truthful presentation, or not?
</p>
<p>
<i> New York </i> with only deer, ruffed grouse, shore-birds, ducks
and a very few woodcock to shoot annually puts into the field
150,222 armed men. In 1909 they killed about <i> 9,000 deer! </i>
</p>
<p>
<i> New Jersey</i>, spending $30,000 in 1912 in efforts to restock
her covers with game, and with a population of 2,537,167, sent out
in 1911 a total army of 61,920 well-armed gunners. How can any of
her game survive?
</p>
<p>
<i> New Hampshire</i>, with only 430,572 population, has 33,542
licensed hunters,&mdash;equal to <i> thirty-three regiments of full
strength! </i>
</p>
<p>
<i> Vermont</i>, with 355,956 people, sends out annually an army of
31,762 men who hunt according to law; and in 1910 they killed 3,649
deer.
</p>
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page60] </span> </a>
<p>
<i> Utah</i>, with only 373,351 population, had 27,800 men in the
field after her very small remnant of game! How can any wild thing
of Utah escape?
</p>
<p>
<i> Montana</i>, population 376,053, had in 1911 an army of 59,291
well-armed men, warring chiefly upon the big game, and swiftly
exterminating it.
</p>
<p>
How long can any of the big game stand before the army of <i> two
and one-half million well-armed men</i>, eager and keen to kill, and
out to get an equivalent for their annual expenditure in guns,
ammunition and other expenses?
</p>
<p>
In addition to the hunters themselves, they are assisted by
thousands of expert guides, thousands of horses, thousands of dogs,
hundreds of automobiles and hundreds of thousands of tents. Each
big-game hunter has an experienced guide who knows the haunts and
habits of the game, the best feeding grounds, the best trails, and
everything else that will aid the hunter in taking the game at a
disadvantage and destroying it. The big-game rifles are of the
highest power, the longest range, the greatest accuracy and the best
repeating mechanism that modern inventive genius can produce. It is
said that in Wyoming the Maxim silencer is now being used. England
has produced a weapon of a new type, called "the scatter rifle,"
which is intended for use on ducks. The best binoculars are used in
searching out the game, and horses carry the hunters and guides as
near as possible to the game. For bears, baits are freely used, and
in the pursuit of pumas, dogs are employed to the limit of the
available supply.
</p>
<p>
The deadliness of the automobile in hunting already is so apparent
that North Dakota has wisely and justly forbidden their use by law,
(1911). The swift machine enables city gunmen to penetrate game
regions they could not reach with horses, and hunt through from four
to six localities per day, instead of one only, as formerly. The use
of automobiles in hunting should be everywhere prohibited.
</p>
<p>
Every appliance and assistance that money can buy, the modern
sportsman secures to help him against the game. The game is beset
during its breeding season by various wild enemies,&mdash;foxes,
cats, wolves, pumas, lynxes, eagles, and many other predatory
species. The only help that it receives is in the form of an annual
close season&mdash;<i>which thus far has saved in America only a few
local moose, white-tailed deer and a few game birds, from steady and
sure extermination</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i> The bag limits on which vast reliance is placed to preserve the
wild game, are a fraud, a delusion and a snare</i>! The few local
exceptions only prove the generality of the rule. In every state,
without one single exception, the bag limits are far too high, and
the laws are of deadly liberality. In many states, the bag limit
laws on birds are an absolute dead letter. Fancy the 125 wardens of
New York enforcing the bag-limit laws on 150,000 gunners! It is this
horrible condition that is enabling the licensed army of destruction
to get in its deadly work on the game, all over the world. In
America, the over-liberality of the laws are to blame for two-thirds
of the carnival of slaughter, and the successful evasions of the law
are responsible for the other third.

The only remedy for the present extermination of game according to
law that so rapidly and so furiously is proceeding all over the
United States, Canada, Alaska, and Africa, is ten-year close seasons
on all the species threatened with extinction, and immensely reduced
open seasons and bag limits on all the others.
</p>
<p>
Will the people who still have wild game take heed now, and clamp
down the brakes, hard and fast before it is too late, or will they
have their game exterminated?
</p>
<p>
Shall we have five-year close seasons, or close seasons of 500
years? We must take our choice.
</p>
<p>
Shall we hand down to our children a gameless continent, with all
the shame that such a calamity will entail?
</p>
<p>
We have <i> got </i> to answer these questions like men, or they
will soon be answered for us by the extermination of the wild life.
For twenty-five years we have been smarting under the disgrace of
the extermination of our bison millions. Let us not repeat the dose
through the destruction of other species.

In warfare, a <i> guerrilla, or bushwhacker</i>, is an armed man who
recognizes none of the rules of civilized warfare, and very often
has no commander. In France he is called a "franc-tireur," or
free-shooter. The guerrilla goes out to live on the country, to
skulk, to war on the weak, and never attack save from ambush, or
when the odds clearly are on his side. His military status is barely
one remove from that of the spy.
</p>
<p>
The meat-shooters who harry the game and other wild life in order to
use it as a staple food supply; the Italians, negroes and others who
shoot song-birds as food; the plume-hunters and the hide-and-tusk
hunters all over the world are the guerrillas of the Army of
Destruction. Let us consider some of these grand divisions in
detail.
</p>
<p>
Here is an inexorable law of Nature, to which there are no
exceptions:
</p>
<p>
<i> No wild species of bird, mammal, reptile or fish can withstand
exploitation for commercial purposes</i>.
</p>
<p>
The men who pursue wild creatures for the money or other value there
is in them, never give up. They work at slaughter when other men are
enjoying life, or are asleep. If they are persistent, no species on
which they fix the Evil Eye escapes extermination at their hands.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone question this statement? If so let him turn backward and
look at the lists of dead and dying species.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Division Of Meat-Shooters </span> contains all men who sordidly shoot for the frying-pan,&mdash;to save bacon and beef at the expense of the public, or for the markets. There are a few wilderness regions so remote and so difficult of access that the transportation of meat into them is a matter of much difficulty and expense. There are a very few men in North America who are justified in "living off the country," <i> for short periods</i>. The genuine prospectors always have been counted in this class; but all miners who are fully located, all lumbermen and railway-builders certainly are not in the prospector's class. They are abundantly able to maintain continuous lines of communication for the transit of beef and mutton.
</p>
<p>
Of all the meat-shooters, the market-gunners who prey on wild fowl
and ground game birds for the big-city markets are the most deadly
to wild life. Enough geese, ducks, brant, quail, ruffed grouse,
prairie chickens, heath hens and wild pigeons have been butchered by
gunners and netters for "the market" to have stocked the whole
world. No section <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page64] </span> </a> containing a good supply of
game has escaped. In the United States the great
slaughtering-grounds have been Cape Cod; Great South Bay, New York;
Currituck Sound, North Carolina; Marsh Island, Louisiana; the
southwest corner of Louisiana; the Sunk Lands of Arkansas; the lake
regions of Minnesota; the prairies of the whole middle West; Great
Salt Lake; the Klamath Lake region (Oregon) and southern California.

	Killing Mallards for the New Orleans Market. The Purchase of This Island by Mrs. Russell Sage has now Converted it Into a Bird Sanctuary
</p>
<p>
The output of this systematic bird slaughter has supplied the greedy
game markets of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington,
Baltimore, Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San
Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. The history of this industry, its
methods, its carnage, its profits and its losses would make a
volume, but we can not enter upon it here. Beyond reasonable doubt,
this awful traffic in dead game is responsible for at least
three-fourths of the slaughter that has reduced our game birds to a
mere remnant of their former abundance. There is no influence so
deadly to wild life as that of the market gunner who works six days
a week, from sunrise until sunset, hunting down and killing every
game bird that he can reach with a choke-bore gun.
</p>
<p>
During the past five years, several of the once-great killing
grounds have been so thoroughly "shot out" that they have ceased to
hold their former rank. This is the case with the Minnesota Lakes,
the Sunk Lands of Arkansas, the Klamath Lakes of Oregon, and I think
it is also true of southern California. The Klamath Lakes have been
taken over by the Government as a bird refuge. Currituck Sound, at
the northeastern corner of North Carolina, has been so bottled up by
the Bayne law of New York <a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page65] </span> </a> State that Currituck's
greatest market has been cut off. Last year only one-half the usual
number of ducks and geese were killed; and already many
"professional" duck and brant shooters have abandoned the business
because the commission merchants no longer will buy dead birds.

Very many enormous bags of game have been made in a day by market
gunners: but rarely have they published any of their records. The
greatest kill of which I ever have heard occurred under the auspices
of the Glenn County Club, in southern California, on February 5,
1906. Two men, armed with automatic shot-guns, fired five shots
apiece, and got ten geese out of one flock. In one hour they killed
<i> two hundred and eighteen geese</i>, and their bag for the day
was <i> four hundred and fifty geese! </i> The shooter who wrote the
story for publication (on February 12, at Willows, Glenn County,
California) said: "It being warm weather, the birds had to be
shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling." A photograph
was made of the "one hour's slaughter" of two hundred and eighteen
geese, and it was published in a western magazine with "C.H.B.'s"
story, nearly all of which will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">
Chapter XV</a>.
</p>
<p>
The reasons why market shooting is so deadly destructive to wild
life are not obscure.
</p>
<p>
The true sportsman hunts during a very few days only each year. The
market gunners shoot early and late, six days a week, month after
month. When game is abundant, the price is low, and a great quantity
must be killed in order to make it pay well. When game is scarce,
the market prices are high, and the shooter makes the utmost
exertions to find the last of the game in order to secure the "big
money."
</p>
<p>
When game is protected by law, thousands of people with money desire
it for their tables, just the same, and are willing to pay fabulous
prices for what they want, when they want it. Many a dealer is quite
willing to run the risk of fines, because fines don't really hurt;
they are only annoying. The dealer wishes to make the big profit,
and <i> retain his customers</i>; "and besides," he reasons, "if I
don't supply him some one else will; so what is the difference?"
</p>
<p>
When game is scarce, prices high and the consumer's money ready,
there are a hundred tricks to which shooters and dealers willingly
resort to ship and receive unlawful game without detection. It takes
the very <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page66] </span> </a> best kind of game wardens,&mdash;genuine
detectives, in fact,&mdash;to ferret out these cunning illegal
practices, and catch lawbreakers "with the goods on them," so that
they can be punished. Mind you, convictions can not be secured at
<i> both </i> ends of the line save by the most extraordinary good
fortune, and usually the shooter and shipper escape, even when the
dealer is apprehended and fined.

</p>
<p>
Here are some of the methods that have been practiced in the past in
getting illegal game into the New York market:
</p>
<p>
Ruffed grouse and quail have both been shipped in butter firkins,
marked "butter"; and latterly, butter has actually been packed
solidly on top of the birds.
</p>
<p>
Ruffed grouse and quail very often have been shipped in egg crates,
marked "eggs." They have been shipped in trunks and suit
cases,&mdash;a very <a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page67] </span> </a> common method for illegal
game birds, all over the United States. In Oklahoma when a man
refuses to open his trunk for a game warden, the warden joyously
gets out his brace and bitt, and bores an inch hole into the lower
story of the trunk. If dead birds are there, the tell-tale auger
quickly reveals them.
</p>
<p>
Three years ago, I was told that certain milk-wagons on Long Island
made daily collections of dead ducks intended for the New York
market, and the drivers kindly shipped them by express from the end
of the route.
</p>
<p>
Once upon a time, a New York man gave notice that on a certain date
he would be in a certain town in St. Lawrence County, New York, with
a palace horse-car, "to buy horses." Car and man appeared there as
advertised. Very ostentatiously, he bought one horse, and had it
taken aboard the car before the gaze of the admiring populace. At
night, when the A.P. had gone to bed, many men appeared, and into
the horseless end of that car, they loaded thousands of ruffed
grouse. The game warden who described the incident to me said: "That
man pulled out for New York with one horse and <i> half a car load
of ruffed grouse</i>!"
</p>
<p>
Whenever a good market exists for the sale of game, as sure as the
world that market will be supplied. Twenty-six states forbid by law
the sale of <i> their own </i> "protected" game, but twenty of them
do <i> not </i> expressly prohibit the sale of game stolen from
neighboring states! That is <i> a very, very weak point in the laws
of all those states</i>. A child can see how it works. Take
Pittsburgh as a case in point.
</p>
<p>
In the winter and spring of 1912 the State Game Commission of
Pennsylvania found that quail and ruffed grouse were being sold in
Pittsburgh, in large quantities. The state laws were well enforced,
and it was believed that the birds were not being killed in
Pennsylvania. Some other state was being <i> robbed</i>!
</p>
<p>
The Game Commission went to work, and in a very short time certain
game-dealers of Pittsburgh were arrested. At first they tried to
bluff their way out of their difficulty, and even went as far as to
bring charges against the game-warden whom the Commission had
instructed to buy some of their illegal game, and pay for it. But
the net of the law tightened upon them so quickly and so tightly
that they threw up their hands and begged for mercy.

It was found that those Pittsburgh game-dealers were selling quail
and grouse that had been stolen in thousands, from the state of
Kentucky! Between the state game laws, working in lovely harmony
with the Lacey federal law that prohibits the shipment of game
illegally killed or sold, the whole bad business was laid bare, and
signed confessions were promptly obtained from the shippers in
Kentucky.
</p>
<p>
At that very time, a good bill for the better protection of her game
was before the Kentucky legislature; and a certain member was
vigorously opposing it, as he had successfully done in previous
years. He was told that the state was being robbed, but refused to
believe it. Then a signed confession was laid before him, bearing
the name of the man who was instigating his opposition,&mdash;his
friend,&mdash;who confessed that he had <a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page68] </span> </a>
illegally bought and shipped to Pittsburgh over 5,000 birds. The
objector literally threw up his hands, and said, "I have been <i>
wrong! </i> Let the bill go through!" And it went.
</p>
<p>
Before the passage of the Bayne law, New York City was a "fence" for
the sale of grouse illegally killed in Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and I know not how many other states. The
Bayne law stopped all that business, abruptly and forever; and if
the ruffed grouse, quail and ducks of the Eastern States are offered
for sale in Chicago, Cincinnati, Baltimore and Washington, the
people of New York and Massachusetts can at least be assured that
they are not to blame. Those two states now maintain no "fences" for
the sale of game that has been stolen from other states. They have
both set their houses in order, and set two examples for forty other
states to follow.
</p>
<p>
The remedy for all this miserable game-stealing, law-breaking
business is simple and easily obtained. Let each state of the United
States and each province and Canada <i> enact a Bayne law,
absolutely prohibiting the sale of all wild native game</i>, and the
thing is done! But nothing short of that will be really effective.
It will not do at all to let state laws rest with merely forbidding
the sale of game "protected by the State;" for that law is full of
loop-holes. It does much good service, yes; but what earthly <i>
objection </i> can there be in any state to the enactment of a law
that is sweepingly effective, and which can not be evaded, save
through the criminal connivance of officers of the law?
</p>
<p class="clearall">
	By way of illustration, to show what the sale of wild game means to the remnant of our game, and the wicked slaughter of non-game birds to which it leads, consider these figures:

Shortly after that seizure American quail became so scarce that in
effect they totally disappeared from the banquet tables of New York.
I can not recall having been served with one since 1903, but the
little Egyptian quail can be legally imported and sold when
officially tagged.
</p>
<p>
Few persons away from the firing line realize the far-reaching
effects of the sale of wild game. Here are a few flashes from the
searchlight:
</p>
<p>
At Hangkow, China, Mr. C. William Beebe found that during his visit
in 1911, over 46,000 pheasants of various species were shipped from
that port on one cold-storage steamer to the London market. And this
when English pheasants were selling in the Covent Garden market at
from two to three shillings each, for <i> fresh </i> birds!
</p>
<p>
In 1910, 1,200 ptarmigan from Norway, bound for the Chicago market,
passed through the port of New York,&mdash;not by any means the
first or the last shipment of the kind. The epicures of Chicago are
being permitted to comb the game out of Norway.
</p>
<p>
In 1910, 70,000 <i> dozen </i> Egyptian quail were shipped to Europe
from Alexandria, Egypt. Just why that species has not already been
exterminated, is a zoological mystery; but extermination surely will
come some day, and I think it will be in the near future.
</p>
<p>
The coast of China has been raked and scraped for wild ducks to ship
to New York,&mdash;prior to the passage of the Bayne law! I have
forgotten the figures that once were given me, but they were an
astonishing number of thousands for the year.
</p>
<p>
The Division of Negroes and Poor Whites who kill song and other
birds indiscriminately will be found in a separate chapter.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Division Of "Resident" Game-Butchers. </span> &mdash;This refers to the men who live in the haunts of big game, where wardens are the most of the time totally absent, and where bucks, does and fawns of hoofed big game may be killed in season and out of season, with impunity. It includes guides, ranchmen, sheep-herders, cowboys, miners, lumbermen and floaters generally. In times past, certain taxidermists of Montana promoted the slaughter of wild bison in the Yellowstone Park, and it was a pair of rascally taxidermists who killed, or caused to be killed in Lost Park, in 1897, the very last bison of Colorado.
</p>
<p>
It seems to be natural for the minds of men who live in America in
the haunts of big game to drift into the idea that the wild game
around them is all theirs. Very few of them recognize the fact that
every other man, woman and child in a given state or province has
vested rights in its wild game. It is natural for a frontiersman to
feel that because he is in the wilds he has a God-given right to
live off the country; but to-day <i> that idea is totally wrong</i>!
If some way can not be found to curb that all-pervading propensity
among our frontiersmen, then we may as well bid all our open-field
big game a long farewell; for the deadly "residents" surely will
exterminate it, outside the game preserves. The "residents" are, in
my opinion, about ten times more destructive than the sportsmen. A
sportsman in quest of large game is in the field only from ten to
thirty <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page70] </span> </a> days; all his movements are known, and all
his trophies are seen and counted. His killing is limited by law,
and upon him the law is actually enforced. Often a resident hunts
the whole twelve months of the year,&mdash;for food, for amusement,
and for trophies to sell. Rarely does a game warden reach his cabin;
because the wardens are few, the distances great and the frontier
cabins are widely scattered.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Carl Pickhardt told me of a guide in Newfoundland who had a shed
in the woods hanging full of bodies of caribou, and who admitted to
him that while the law allowed him five caribou each year, he killed
each year about twenty-five.
</p>
<p>
Mr. J.M. Phillips knows of a mountain in British Columbia, once well
stocked with goats, on which the goats have been completely
exterminated by one man who lives within easy striking distance of
them, and who finds goat meat to his liking.
</p>
<p>
I have been reliably informed that in 1911, at Haha Lake, near
Grande Bay, Saguenay District, P.Q., one family of six persons
killed thirty-four woodland caribou and six moose. This meant the
waste of about 14,000 pounds of good meat, and the death of several
female animals.
</p>
<p>
In 1886 I knew a man named Owens who lived on the head of Sunday
Creek, Montana, who told me that in 1884-5 he killed thirty-five
mule deer for himself and family. The family ate as much as
possible, the dogs ate all they could, and in the spring the
remainder spoiled. Now there is not a deer, an antelope, or a sage
grouse within fifty miles of that lifeless waste.
</p>
<p>
Here is a Montana object lesson on the frame of mind of the
"resident" hunter, copied from <i> Outdoor Life </i> Magazine
(Denver) for February, 1912. It is from a letter to the Editor,
written by C.B. Davis.
</p>
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
November 27, 28, 29, and 30, 1911, will remain a red letter day with
a half thousand men for years to come. These half thousand men
gathered along the border of the Yellowstone National Park, near
Gardiner, Montana, at a point known as Buffalo Flats, to exterminate
elk. The snow had driven the elk down to the foothills, and Buffalo
Flats is on the border of the park and outside the park. The elk
entered this little valley for food. Like hungry wolves, shooters,
not hunters, gathered along the border waiting to catch an elk off
the "reservation" and kill it.
	</p>
	<p>
On November 27th about 1500 elk crossed the line, and the slaughter
began. I have not the data of the number killed this day, but it was
hundreds.
	</p>
	<p>
On the 28th, twenty-two stepped over and were promptly executed.
Like Custer's band, not one escaped. On the evening of the 28th, 600
were sighted just over the line, and the army of 125 brave men
entrenched themselves for the battle which was expected to open next
morning. Before daylight of the 29th the battle began. The elk were
over the line, feeding on Buffalo Flats. One hundred and twenty-five
men poured bullets into this band of 600 elk till the ground was red
with blood and strewn with carcasses, and in their madness they shot
each other. One man was shot through the ear,&mdash;a close call;
another received a bullet through his coat sleeve, and another was
shot through the bowels and can't live.
	</p>
	<p>
My informer told me he participated in the slaughter, and while he
would not take fifty dollars for what he saw, and the experience he
went through, yet he would not go through it again for $1,000. When
my informer got back to Gardiner that day there were four sleigh
loads of elk, each load containing from twenty to thirty-five elk,
besides thirty-two mules and horses carrying one to two each. This
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page71]
</span> </a> was only a part of the slaughter. Hundreds more were
carried to other points; and this was only one day's work.
	</p>
	<p>
Hundreds of wounded elk wandered back into the park to die, and
others died outside the park. The station at Livingston, Montana,
for a week looked like a packing house. Carcasses were piled up on
the trucks and depot platform. The baggage cars were loaded with elk
going to points east and west of Livingston.
	</p>
	<p>
Maybe this is all right. Maybe the government can't stop the elk
from crossing the line. Maybe the elk were helped over; but it
strikes me there is something wrong somewhere.
	</p>
</div>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Division Of Hired Laborers. </span> &mdash;The scourge of lumber-camps in big-game territory, the mining camps and the railroad-builders is a long story, and if told in detail it would make several chapters. Their awful destructiveness is well known. It is a common thing for "the boss" to hire a hunter to kill big game to supply the hungry outfit, and save beef and pork.
</p>
<p>
The abuses arising from this source easily could be checked, and
finally suppressed. A ten-line law would do the
business,&mdash;forbidding any person employed in any camp of sheep
men, cattle men, lumbermen, miners, railway laborers or excavators
to own or use a rifle in hunting wild game; and forbidding any
employer of labor to feed those laborers, or permit them to be fed,
on the flesh of wild game mammals or birds. "Camp" laborers are not
"pioneers;" not by a long shot! They are soldiers of Commerce, and
makers of money.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> A Mountain Sheep Case In Colorado. </span> &mdash;The state of Colorado sincerely desires to protect and perpetuate its slender remnant of mountain sheep, but as usual the Lawless Miscreant is abroad to thwart the efforts of the guardians of the game. Every state that strives to protect its big game has such doings as this to contend with:
</p>
<p>
In the winter of 1911-12, a resident poacher brought into Grant,
Colorado, a lot of mountain sheep meat <i> for sale</i>; and he
actually sold it to residents of that town! The price was <i> six
cents per pound</i>. A lot of it was purchased by the railway
station-agent. I have no doubt that the same man who did that job,
which was made possible only by the co-operation of the citizens of
Grant, will try the same poaching-and-selling game next winter,
unless the State Game Commissioner is able to bring him to book.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> A Wyoming Case In Point. </span> &mdash;As a fair sample of what game wardens, and the general public, are sometimes compelled to endure through the improper decisions of judges, I will cite this case:
</p>
<p>
In the Shoshone Mountains of northern Wyoming, about fifty miles or
so from the town of Cody, in the winter of 1911-12 a man was engaged
in trapping coyotes. It was currently reported that he had been
"driven out of Montana and Idaho." He had scores of traps. He baited
his traps with the flesh of deer, elk calves and grouse, all
illegally killed and illegally used for that purpose. A man of my
acquaintance saw some of this game meat actually used as described.

<p>
The man was a notorious character, and cruel in the extreme. Finally
a <a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page72]
</span> </a> game warden caught him red-handed, arrested him, and
took him to Cody for trial. It happened that the judge on the bench
had once trapped with him, and therefore "he set the game-killer
free, while the game-warden was roasted."
</p>
<p>
That wolf-trapper once took into the mountains a horse, to kill and
use as bear-bait. The animal was blind in one eye, and because it
would not graze precisely where the wolfer desired it to remain, he
deliberately destroyed the sight of its good eye, and left it for
days, without the ability to find water.
</p>
<p>
Think of the fate of any wild animal that unkind Fate places at the
mercy of such a man!

		UNSEEN FOES OF WILD LIFE

</div>
<p>
Quite unintentionally on his part, Man, the arch destroyer and the
most predatory and merciless of all animal species except the
wolves, has rendered a great service to all the birds that live or
nest upon the ground. His relentless pursuit and destruction of the
savage-tempered, strong-jawed fur-bearing animals is in part the
salvation of the ground birds of to-day and yesterday. If the teeth
and claws had been permitted to multiply unchecked down to the
present time, with man's warfare on the upland game proceeding as it
has done, scores upon scores of species long ere this would have
been exterminated.
</p>
<p>
But the slaughter of the millions of North American foxes, wolves,
weasels, skunks, and mink has so overwhelmingly reduced the
four-footed enemies of the birds that the balance of wild Nature has
been preserved. As a rule, the few predatory wild animals that
remain are not slaughtering the birds to a serious extent; and for
this we may well be thankful.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Domestic Cat. </span> &mdash;In such thickly settled communities as our northern states, from the Atlantic coast to the sandhills of Kansas and Nebraska, the domestic cat is probably the greatest four-footed scourge of bird life. Thousands of persons who never have seen a hunting cat in action will doubt this statement, but the proof of its truthfulness is only too painfully abundant.
</p>
<p>
Unhappily it is the way of the hunting cat to stalk unseen, and to
kill the very birds that are most friendly with man, and most
helpful to him in his farming and fruit-growing business. The quail
is about the only game bird that the cat affects seriously, and to
it the cat is very destructive. It is the robin, catbird, thrush,
bluebird, dove, woodpecker, chickadee, phoebe, tanager and other
birds of the lawn, the garden and orchard that afford good hunting
for sly and savage old Thomas.
</p>
<p>
When I was a boy in my 'teens, I had a lasting series of object
lessons on the cat as a predatory animal. Our "Betty" was the most
ambitious and successful domestic-cat hunter of wild mammals of
which I ever have heard. To her, rats and mice were mere
child's-play, and after a time their pursuit offered such tame sport
that she sought fresh fields for her prowess. Then she brought in
young rabbits, chipmunks and thirteen-lined spermophiles, and once
she came in, quite exhausted, half dragging and half carrying a big,
fat pocket gopher. With her it seemed to be a point of honor that
she should bring in her game and display it. Little did we realize
then that in course of time the wild birds would <a name="Page_74"
id="Page_74"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page74] </span> </a> become
so scarce that their slaughter by house cats would demand
legislative action in the states.
</p>
<p>
In considering the hunting cat, let us call in a credible witness of
the effects of domestic cats on the bob white. The following is an
eye-witness report, by Ernest B. Beardsley, in <i> Outdoor Life </i>
for April, 1912. The locality was Wellington, Sumner County, Kansas.
</p>
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
In the meantime, old Queen was having a high old time up ahead, some
hundred feet by then, running up the bank and back down in the draw.
We had hardly caught up when up goes Mr. Savage's gun and he gives
both barrels. I had seen nothing up to date, but I didn't have long
to wait, for by the time I got up to him and the dog, they were both
in the high grass and had a great, big, common gray maltese
house-cat; and Queen had a half-eaten quail that Mr. Cat was busy
with when disturbed.
	</p>
	<p>
Well, we followed the draw across the field and got nine of a covey
of sixteen that had been ahead of Mr. Cat; and about four o'clock
that evening we killed another white-and-gray cat. While driving
home that night, Mr. Savage told me that he had killed fifty or more
in three or four years. They will get in a draw full of
tumble-grass, on a cold day when quail don't like to fly, and stay
right with them; and even after feeding on two or three, they will
lie and watch, and when the covey moves, they move. When eating time
comes around they are at it again, and to a covey of young birds
they are sure death to the whole covey.
	</p>
	<p>
Well, Will told me never to overlook a house-cat that I found as far
as a quarter of a mile from a farm or ranch, for if they have not
already turned wild, they are learning how easy it is to hunt and
live on game, and are almost as bad. We found Mr. Black-and-White
Hunter had eaten two quail just before we killed him that evening. I
would rather not write what Mr. Savage said when we found the
remains of a partly-eaten bird.
	</p>
	<p>
My advice is, don't let tame cats get away when found out hunting;
for the chances are they have not seen a home in months, and maybe
years,&mdash;and say! but they do get big and bad. When you meet
one, give it to him good, and don't let your dog run up to him until
he is out for keeps. I learned afterwards that was how Will knew it
was a cat. Queen had learned to back off and call for help on cats
some years before.
	</p>
</div>
<p>
In the New York Zoological Park, we have had troubles of our own
with marauding cats. They establish themselves in a day, and quickly
learn where to seek easy game and good cover. In the daytime they
lie close in the thick brush, exactly as tigers do in India, but if
not molested for a period of days, they become bold and attack game
in open view. One bird-killing cat was so shy of man that it was
only after two weeks of hard hunting (mornings and evenings) that it
was killed.
</p>
<p>
We have seen cats catch and kill gray squirrels, chipmunks, robins
and thrushes, and have found the feathers of slaughtered quail. Once
we had gray rabbits breeding in the park, and their number reached
between eighty and ninety. For a time they fearlessly hopped about
in sight from our windows, and they were of great interest to
visitors and to all of us. Then the cats began upon them; and in one
year there was not a rabbit to be seen, save at rare intervals. At
the same time the chipmunks of the park were almost exterminated.
</p>
<p>
That was the last straw, and we began a vigorous war upon those wild
and predatory cats. The cats came off second best. We killed every
cat that was found hunting in the park, and we certainly got some
that were big <a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page75] </span> </a> and bad. We eliminated that pest, and we are
keeping it eliminated. And with what result?
</p>
<p>
In 1911 a covey of eleven quail came and settled in our grounds, and
have remained there. Twenty times at least during the past eight
months (winter and spring) I have seen the flock on the granite
ledge not more than forty feet from the rear window of my office.
Last spring when I left the Administration Building at six o'clock,
after the visitors had gone, I found two half-grown rabbits calmly
roosting on the door-mat. The rabbits are slowly coming back, and
the chipmunks are visibly increasing in number. The gray squirrels
now chase over the walks without fear of any living thing, and our
ducklings and young guineas and peacocks are safe once more.
</p>
<p>
That cats destroy annually in the United States several <i> millions
</i> of very valuable birds, seems fairly beyond question. I believe
that in settled regions they are worse than weasels, foxes, skunks
and mink <i> combined</i>; because there are about one hundred times
as many of them, and those that hunt are not afraid to hunt in the
daytime. Of course I am not saying that <i> all </i> cats hunt wild
game; but in the country I believe that fully one-half of them do.
</p>
<p>
I am personally acquainted with a cat in Indiana, on the farm of
relatives, which is notorious for its hunting propensities, and its
remarkable ability in capturing game. Even the lady who is joint
owner of the cat feels very badly about its destructiveness, and has
said, over and over again, that it ought to be killed; but the cat
is such a family pet that no one in the family has the heart to
destroy it, and as yet no stranger has come forward to play the part
of executioner. The lady in question assured me that to her certain
knowledge that particular cat would watch a nestful of young robins
week after week until they had grown up to such a size that they
were almost ready to fly; then he would kill them and devour them.
Old "Tommy" was too wise to kill the robins when they were unduly
small.
</p>
<p>
In a great book entitled <i> Useful Birds and Their Protection</i>,
by E. H. Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, and
published by the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture in 1905,
there appears, on page 362, many interesting facts on this subject.
For example:
</p>
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
Mr. William Brewster tells of an acquaintance in Maine, who said
that his cat killed about fifty birds a year. Mr. A.C. Dike wrote
[to Mr. Forbush] of a cat owned by a family, and well cared for.
They watched it through one season, and found that it killed
fifty-eight birds, including the young in five nests.
	</p>
	<p>
Nearly a hundred correspondents, scattered through all the counties
of the state, report the cat as one of the greatest enemies of
birds. The reports that have come in of the torturing and killing of
birds by cats are absolutely sickening. The number of birds killed
by them in this state is appalling.
	</p>
	<p>
Some cat lovers believe that each cat kills on the average not more
than ten birds a year; but I have learned of two instances where
more than that number were killed in a single day, and another where
seven were killed. If we assume, however, that the average cat on
the farm kills but ten birds per year, and that there is one cat to
each farm in Massachusetts, we have, in round numbers, seventy
thousand cats, killing seven hundred thousand birds annually.

<p>
In Mr. Forbush's book there is an illustration of the cat which
killed fifty-eight birds in one year, and the animal was
photographed with a dead robin in its mouth. The portrait is
reproduced in this chapter.
</p>
<p>
Last year, a strong effort was made in Massachusetts to enact a law
requiring cats to be licensed. On account of the amount of work
necessary in passing the no-sale-of-game bill, that measure was not
pressed, and so it did not become a law; but another year it will
undoubtedly be passed, for it is a good bill, and extremely
necessary at this time. <i> Such a law is needed in every state</i>!
</p>
<p>
There is a mark by which you may instantly and infallibly know the
worst of the wild cats&mdash;by their presence <i> away from home,
hunting in the open</i>. Kill all such, wherever found. The harmless
cats are domestic in their tastes, and stay close to the family
fireside and the kitchen. Being properly fed, they have no
temptation to become hunters. There are cats and cats, just as there
are men and men: some tolerable, many utterly intolerable. No
sweeping sentiment for <i> all </i> cats should be allowed to stand
in the way of the abatement of the hunting-cat nuisances.
</p>
<p>
<i> Of all men, the farmer cannot afford the luxury of their
existence</i>! It is too expensive. With him it is a matter of
dollars, and cash out of pocket for every hunting cat that he
tolerates in his neighborhood. There are two places in which to
strike the hunting cats: in the open, and in the state legislature.
</p>
<p>
While this chapter was in the hands of the compositors, the hunting
cat and gray rabbit shown in the accompanying illustration were
brought in by a keeper.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Dogs As Destroyers Of Birds. </span> &mdash;I have received many letters from protectors of wild life informing me that the destruction of ground-nesting <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page77] </span> </a> birds, and especially of upland game birds, by roaming dogs, has in some localities become a great curse to bird life. Complaints of this kind have come from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Usually the culprits are <i> hunting dogs</i>&mdash;setters, pointers and hounds.
</p>
<p>
Now, surely it is not necessary to set forth here any argument on
this subject. It is not open to argument, or academic treatment of
any kind. The cold fact is:
</p>
<p>
In the breeding season of birds, and while the young birds are
incapable of quick and strong flight, all dogs, of every
description, should be restrained from free hunting; and all dogs
found hunting in the woods during the season referred to should be
arrested, and their owners should be fined twenty dollars for each
offense. Incidentally, one-half the fine should go to the citizen
who arrests the dog. The method of restraining hunting dogs should
devolve upon dog owners; and the law need only prohibit or punish
the act.
</p>
<p>
Beyond a doubt, in states that still possess quail and ruffed
grouse, free hunting by hunting dogs leads to great destruction of
nests and broods during the breeding season.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Telegraph And Telephone Wires. </span> &mdash;Mr. Daniel C. Beard has strongly called my attention to the slaughter of birds by telegraph wires that has come under his personal observation. His country home, at Redding, Connecticut, is near the main line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway, along which a line of very large poles carries a great number of wires. The wires are so numerous that they form a barrier through which it is difficult for any bird to fly and come out alive and unhurt.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Beard says that among the birds killed or crippled by flying
against those wires near Redding he has seen the following species:
olive-backed thrush, white-throated sparrow and other sparrows,
oriole, blue jay, rail, ruffed grouse, and woodcock. It is a common
practice for employees of the railway, and others living along the
line, to follow the line and pick up on one excursion enough birds
for a pot-pie.
</p>
<p>
Beyond question, the telegraph and telephone wires of the United
States annually exact a heavy toll in bird life, and claim countless
thousands of victims. They may well be set down as one of the unseen
forces destructive to birds.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, we ask, what can be done about it?
</p>
<p>
I am told that in Scotland such slaughter is prevented by the
attachment of small tags or discs to the telephone wires, at
intervals of a few rods, sufficiently near that they attract the
attention of flying birds, and reveal the line of an obstruction.
This system should be adopted in all regions where the conditions
are such that birds kill themselves against telegraph wires, and an
excellent place to begin would be along the line of the N.Y., N.H.
&amp; H. Railway.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Wild Animals. </span> &mdash;Beyond question, it is both desirable and necessary that any excess of wild animals that prey upon our grouse, quail, pheasants, <a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page78] </span> </a> woodcock, snipe, mallard duck, shore birds and other species that nest on the ground, should be killed. Since we must choose between the two, the birds have it! Weasels and foxes and skunks are interesting, and they do much to promote the hilarity of life in rural districts, but they do not destroy insects, and are of comparatively little value as destroyers of the noxious rodents that prey upon farm crops. While a few persons may dispute the second half of this proposition, the burden of proof that my view is wrong will rest upon them; and having spent eighteen years "on the farm," I think I am right. If there is any positive evidence tending to prove that the small carnivores that we class as "vermin" are industrious and persistent destroyers of noxious rodents&mdash;pocket gophers, moles, field-mice and rats&mdash;or that they do not kill wild birds numerously, now is the time to produce it, because the tide of public sentiment is strongly setting against the weasels, mink, foxes and skunks. (Once upon a time, a shrewd young man in the Zoological Park discovered a weasel hiding behind a stone while devouring a sparrow that it had just caught and killed. He stalked it successfully, seized it in his bare hand, and, even though bitten, made good the capture.)
</p>
<p>
The State of Pennsylvania is extensively wooded, with forests and
with brush which affords excellent home quarters and breeding
grounds for mammalian "vermin." The small predatory mammals are so
seriously destructive to ruffed grouse and other ground birds that
the State Game Commission is greatly concerned. When the hunter's
license law is enacted, as it very surely will be at the next
session of the legislature (1913), a portion of the $70,000 that it
will produce each year will be used by the commission in paying
bounties on the destruction of the surplus of vermin. Through the
pursuit of vermin, any farmer can easily win enough bounties to more
than pay the cost of his annual hunting license (one dollar), and
the farmers' boys will find a new interest in life.

In some portions of the Rocky Mountain region, the assaults of the
large predatory mammals and birds on the young of the big-game
species occasionally demand special treatment. In the Yellowstone
Park the pumas multiplied to such an extent and killed so many young
elk that their number had to be systematically reduced. To that end
"Buffalo" Jones was sent out by the Government to find and destroy
the intolerable surplus of pumas. In the course of his campaign he
killed about forty, much to the benefit of the elk herds. Around the
entrance to the den of a big old male puma, Mr. Jones found the
skulls and other remains of nine elk calves that "the old Tom" had
killed and carried there.
</p>
<p>
Pumas and lynxes attack and kill mountain sheep; and the golden
eagle is very partial to mountain sheep lambs and mountain goat
kids. It will not answer to permit birds of that bold and predatory
species to become too numerous in mountains inhabited by goats and
sheep; and the fewer the mountain lions the better, for they, like
the lynx and eagle, have nothing to live upon save the game.
</p>
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page79] </span> </a>
<p>
The wolves and coyotes have learned to seek the ranges of cattle,
horses and sheep, where they still do immense damage, chiefly in
killing young stock. In spite of the great sums that have been paid
out by western states in bounties for the destruction of wolves, in
many, many places the gray wolf still persists, and can not be
exterminated. To the stockmen of the west the wolf question is a
serious matter. The stockmen of Montana say that a government expert
once told them how to get rid of the gray wolves. His instructions
were: "Locate the dens, and kill the young in the dens, soon after
they are born!" "All very easy to <i> say</i>, but a trifle
difficult to <i> do</i>!" said my informant; and the ranchman seem
to think they are yet a long way from a solution of the wolf
question.

	During the past year the destruction of noxious predatory animals in the national forest reserves has seriously occupied the attention of the United States Bureau of Forestry. By the foresters of that bureau the following animals were destroyed in fifteen western states:

	<span class="title"> The Red Squirrel. </span> &mdash;Once in a great while, conditions change in subtle ways, wild creatures unexpectedly increase in number, and a community awakens to the fact that some wild species has become a public nuisance. In a small city park, even gray squirrels may breed and become so fearfully numerous that, in their restless quest for food, they may ravage the nests of the wild birds, kill and devour the young, and become a pest. In the Zoological Park, in 1903, we found that the red squirrels had increased to such a horde that they were driving out all our nesting wild birds, driving out the gray squirrels, and making themselves intolerably obnoxious. We shot sixty of them, and brought the total down to a reasonable number. Wherever he is or whatever his <a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page80] </span> </a> numerical strength, the red squirrel is a bad citizen, and, while we do not by any means favor his extermination, he should resolutely be kept within bounds by the rifle.
</p>
<p>
When a crow nested in our woods, near the Beaver Pond, we were
greatly pleased; but with the feeding of the first brood, the crows
began to carry off ducklings from the wild-fowl pond. After one crow
had been seen to seize and carry away <i> five </i> young ducks in
one forenoon, we decided that the constitutional limit had been
reached, for we did not propose that all our young mallards should
be swept into the awful vortex of that crow nest. We took those
young crows and reared them by hand; but the old one had acquired a
bad habit, and she persisted in carrying off young ducks until we
had to end her existence with a gun. It was a painful operation, but
there was no other way.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Bird-Destroying Birds. </span> &mdash;There are several species of birds that may at once be put under sentence of death for their destructiveness of useful birds, without any extenuating circumstances worth mentioning. Four of these are <i> Cooper's Hawk</i>, the <i> Sharp-Shinned Hawk, Pigeon Hawk </i> and <i> Duck Hawk</i>. Fortunately these species are not so numerous that we need lose any sleep over them. Indeed, I think that today it would be a mighty good collector who could find one specimen in seven days' hunting. Like all other species, these, too, are being shot out of our bird fauna.
</p>
<p>
Several species of bird-eating birds are trembling in the balance,
and under grave suspicion. Some of them are the <i> Great Horned
Owl, Screech Owl, Butcher Bird </i> or <i> Great Northern
Shrike</i>. The only circumstance that saves these birds from
instant condemnation is the delightful amount of rats, mice, moles,
gophers and noxious insects that they annually consume. In view of
the awful destructiveness of the accursed bubonic-plague-carrying
rat, we are impelled to think long before placing in our killing
list even the great horned owl, who really does <a name="Page_81"
id="Page_81"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page81] </span> </a> levy a
heavy tax on our upland game birds. As to the butcher bird, we feel
that we ought to kill him, but in view of his record on wild mice
and rats, we hesitate, and finally decline.

	<span class="title"> Snakes. </span> &mdash;Mr. Thomas M. Upp, a close and long observer of wild things wishes it distinctly understood that while the common black-snakes and racers are practically harmless to birds, the <i> Pilot Black-Snake</i>,&mdash;long, thick and truculent,&mdash;is a great scourge to nesting birds. It seems to be deserving of death. Mr. Upp speaks from personal knowledge, and his condemnation of the species referred to is quite sweeping. At the same time Mr. Raymond L. Ditmars points out the fact that this serpent feeds during 6 months of the year on mice, and in doing so renders good service. In the South it is called the "Mouse Snake."

	<div class="subtitle">
		THE DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY DISEASES
	</div>
</div>
<p>
Every cause that has the effect of reducing the total of wild-life
population is now a matter of importance to mankind. The violent and
universal disturbance of the balance of Nature that already has
taken place throughout the temperate and frigid zone offers not only
food for thought, but it calls for vigorous action.
</p>
<p>
There are vast sections in the populous centres of western
civilization where the destruction of species, even to the point of
extermination, is fairly inevitable. It is the way of Christian man
to destroy all wild life that comes within the sphere of influence
of his iron heel. With the exception of the big game, this
destruction is largely a temperamental result, peculiar to the
highest civilization. In India where the same fields have been
plowed for wheat and dahl and raggi for at least 2,000 years, the
Indian antelope, or "black buck," the saras crane and the adjutant
stalk through the crops, and the nilgai and gazelle inhabit the
eroded ravines in an agricultural land that averages 1,200 people to
the square mile!
</p>
<p>
We have seen that even in farming country, where mud villages are as
thick as farm houses in Nebraska, wild animals and even hoofed game
can live and hold their own through hundreds of years of close
association with man. The explanation is that the Hindus regard wild
animals as creatures entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, and they are not anxious to shoot every wild animal that
shows its head. In the United States, nearly every game-inhabited
community is animated by a feeling that every wild animal must
necessarily be killed as soon as seen; and this sentiment often
leads to disgraceful things. For instance, in some parts of New
England a deer straying into a town is at once beset by the hue and
cry, and it is chased and assaulted until it is dead, by violent and
disgraceful means. New York State, however, seems to have outgrown
that spirit. During the past ten years, at least a dozen deer in
distress have been rescued from the Hudson River, or in inland
towns, or in barnyards in the suburbs of Yonkers and New York, and
carefully cared for until "the zoo people" could be communicated
with. Last winter about 13 exhausted grebes and one loon were picked
up, cared for and finally shipped with tender care to the Zoological
Park. One distressed dovekie was picked up, but failed to survive.
</p>
<p>
The sentiment for the conservation of wild life has changed the
mental attitude of very many people. The old Chinese-Malay spirit
which cries <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page83] </span> </a> "Kill! Kill!" and at once runs amuck among
suddenly discovered wild animals, is slowly being replaced by a more
humane and intelligent sentiment. This is one of the hopeful and
encouraging signs of the times.
</p>
<p>
The destruction of wild animals by natural causes is an interesting
subject, even though painful. We need to know how much destruction
is wrought by influences wholly beyond the control of man, and a few
cases must be cited.
</p>
<p class="clearall">
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Rinderpest In Africa. </span> &mdash;Probably the greatest slaughter ever wrought upon wild animals by diseases during historic times, was by rinderpest, a cattle plague which afflicted Africa in the last decade of the previous century. Originally, the disease reached Africa by way of Egypt, and came as an importation from Europe. From Egypt it steadily traveled southward, reaching Somaliland in 1889. In 1896 it reached the Zambesi River and entered Rhodesia. From thence it went on southward almost to the Cape. Not only did it sweep away ninety percent of the native cattle but it also destroyed more than seventy-five per cent of the buffalos, antelopes and other hoofed game of Rhodesia. It was feared that many species would be completely exterminated, but happily that fear was not realized. The buffalo and antelope herds were fifteen years in breeding up again to a reasonable number, but thanks to the respite from hunters which they enjoyed for several years, finally they did recover. Throughout British East Africa the supply of big game in 1905 was very great, but since that time it has been very greatly diminished by shooting.
</p>
<p class="clearall">
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Caribou Disease. </span> &mdash;From time to time reports have come from the Province of Quebec, and I think from Maine and New Brunswick also, of many caribou having died of disease. The nature of that disease has remained a mystery, because it seems that no pathologist ever has had an opportunity to investigate it. Fortunately, however, the alleged disease never has been sufficiently wide-spread or continuous to make appreciable inroads on the total number of caribou, and apparently the trouble has been local.
</p>
<p class="clearall">
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Scab In Mountain Sheep. </span> &mdash;"Scab" is a contagious and persistent skin disease that affects sheep, and is destructive when not controlled. Fifteen years ago it prevailed in some portions of the west. In Colorado it has several times been reported that many bighorn mountain sheep were killed by "scab," which was contracted on wild mountain pastures that had been gone over by domestic sheep carrying that disease. From the reports current at that time, we inferred that about 200 mountain sheep had been affected. It was feared that the disease would spread through the wild flocks and become general, but this did not occur. It seems that the remnant flocks had become so isolated from one another that the isolation of the affected flocks saved the others.
</p>
<p class="clearall">
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Lumpy-Jaw In Antelope And Sheep. </span> &mdash;It is a lamentable fact that some, at least, of the United States herds of prong-horned antelope are afflicted with a very deadly chronic infective disease known as actinomycosis, or <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page84] </span> </a> lumpy-jaw. It has been brought into the Zoological Park five times, by specimens shipped from Colorado, Texas, Wyoming and Montana. I think our first cases came to us in 1902.
</p>
<p>
In its early stage this disease is so subtle and slow that it is
months in developing; and this feature renders it all the more
deadly, through the spread of infection long before the ailment can
be discovered.
</p>
<p>
One of our antelope arrivals, apparently in perfect health when
received, was on general principles kept isolated in rigid
quarantine for two months. At the expiration of that period, no
disease of any kind having become manifest, the animal was placed on
exhibition, with two others that had been in the Park for more than
a year, in perfect health.
</p>
<p>
In one more week the late arrival developed a swelling on its jaw,
drooled at the corner of the mouth, and became feverish,&mdash;sure
symptoms of the dread disease. At once it was removed and isolated,
but in about 10 days it died. The other two antelopes were promptly
attacked, and eventually died.
</p>
<p>
The course of the disease is very intense, and thus far it has
proven incurable in our wild animals. We have lost about 10
antelopes from it, and one deer, usually, in each case, within ten
days or two weeks from the discovery of the first outward
sign,&mdash;the well known swelling on the jaw. One case that was
detected immediately upon arrival was very persistently treated by
Dr. Blair, and the animal actually survived for four months, but
finally it succumbed. From first to last not a single case was
cured.
</p>
<p>
In 1912, the future of the prong-horned antelope in real captivity
seems hopeless. We have decided not to bring any more specimens to
our institution, partly because all available candidates seem
reasonably certain to be affected with lumpy-jaw, and partly because
we are unwilling to run further risks of having other hoofed animals
inoculated by them. Today we are anxiously wondering whether the jaw
disease of the prong-horn is destined to exterminate the species.
Such a catastrophe is much to be feared. This is probably one of the
reasons why the antelope is steadily disappearing, despite
protection.
</p>
<p>
In 1906 we discovered the existence of actinomycosis among the black
mountain sheep of northern British Columbia. Two specimens out of
six were badly affected, the bones of the jaws being greatly
enlarged, and perforated by deep pits. The black sheep of the
Stickine and Iskoot regions are so seldom seen by white men, save
when a sportsman kills his allotment of three specimens, we really
do not know anything about the extent to which actinomycosis
prevails in those herds, or how deadly are its effects. One thing
seems quite certain, from the appearance of the diseased skulls
found by the writer in the taxidermic laboratory of Frederick
Sauter, in New York. The enormous swelling of the diseased jaw bones
clearly indicates a disease that in some cases affects its victim
throughout many months. Such a condition as we found in those sheep
could not have been reached in a few days after the disease became
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page85]
</span> </a> apparent. Now, in our antelopes, the collapse and death
of the victim usually occurred in about 10 days from the time that
the first swelling was observed: which means a very virulent
disease, and rapid progress at the climax. The jaw of one of our
antelopes, which was figured in Dr. Blair's paper in the Eleventh
Annual Report of the New York Zoological Society (1906) shows only a
very slight lesion, in comparison with those of the mountain sheep.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion is that among the sheep, this disease does not carry
off its victims in any short period like 10 days. The animal must
survive for some months after it becomes apparent. At least two
parties of American sportsmen have shot rams afflicted with this
disease, but I have no reports of any sheep having been found dead
from this cause.
</p>
<p>
This disease is well known among domestic cattle, but so far as we
are aware it never before has been found among wild animals. The
black sheep herds wherein it was found in British Columbia are
absolutely isolated from domestic cattle and all their influences,
and therefore it seems quite certain that the disease developed
among the sheep spontaneously,&mdash;a remarkable episode, to say
the least. Whether it will exterminate the black mountain sheep
species, and in time spread to the white sheep of the northwest, is
of course a matter of conjecture; but there is nothing in the world
to prevent a calamity of that kind. The white sheep of Yukon
Territory range southward until in the Sheslay Mountains they touch
the sphere of influence of the black sheep, where the disease could
easily be transmitted. It would be a good thing if there existed
between the two species a sheepless zone about 200 miles wide.
</p>
<p>
I greatly fear that actinomycosis is destined to play an important
part in the final extinction that seems to be the impending fate of
the beautiful and valuable prong-horned antelope. In view of our
hard experiences, extending through ten years (1902-1912), I think
this fear is justified. All persons who live in country still
inhabited by antelope are urged to watch for this disease. If any
antelopes are found dead, see if the lower jaw is badly swollen and
discharging pus. If it is, bury the body quickly, burn the ground
over, and advise the writer regarding the case.
</p>

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Rabbit Plague. </span> &mdash;One of the strangest freaks of Nature of which we know as effecting the wholesale destruction of wild animals by disease is the rabbit plague. In the northern wilderness, and particularly central Canada, where rabbits exist in great numbers and supply the wants of a large carnivorous population, this plague is well known, and among trappers and woodsmen is a common topic of conversation. The best treatment of the subject is to be found in Ernest T. Seton's "Life Histories of Northern Animals", Vol. I, p. 640 et seq. From this I quote:
</p>
<p>
"Invariably the year of greatest numbers [of rabbits] is followed by
a year of plague, which sweeps them away, leaving few or no rabbits
in the land. The denser the rabbit population, the more drastically
is it <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page86] </span> </a> ravaged by the plague. They are wiped out in
a single spring by epidemic diseases usually characterized by
swellings of the throat, sores under the armpits and groins, and by
diarrhea."
</p>
<p>
"The year 1885 was for the country around Carberry 'a rabbit year,'
the greatest ever known in that country. The number of rabbits was
incredible. W.R. Hine killed 75 in two hours, and estimated that he
could have killed 500 in a day. The farmers were stricken with fear
that the rabbit pest of Australia was to be repeated in Manitoba.
But the years 1886-7 changed all that. The rabbits died until their
bodies dotted the country in thousands. The plague seemed to kill
all the members of the vast host of 1885."
</p>
<p>
The strangest item of Mr. Seton's story is yet to be told. In 1890
Mr. Seton stocked his park at Cos Cob, Conn., with hares and rabbits
from several widely separated localities. In 1903, the plague came
and swept them all away. Mr. Seton sent specimens to the Zoological
Park for examination by the Park veterinary surgeon, Dr. W. Reid
Blair. They were found to be infested by great numbers of a
dangerous bloodsucking parasite known as <i> Strongylus
strigosus</i>, which produces death by anemia and emaciation. There
were hundreds of those parasites in each animal. I assisted in the
examination, and was shown by Dr. Blair, under the microscope, that
<i> Strongylus </i> puts forth eggs literally by hundreds of
thousands!
</p>
<p>
The life history of that parasite is not well known, but it may
easily develop that the cycle of its maximum destructiveness is
seven years, and therefore it may be accountable for the seven-year
plague among the hares and rabbits of the northern United States and
Canada.
</p>
<p>
Possibly <i> Strongylus strigosus </i> is all that stands between
Canada and a pest of rabbits like that of Australia. Just why this
parasite is inoperative in Australia, or why it has not been
introduced there to lessen the rabbit evil, we do not know. Mr.
Seton declares that the rabbits of his park were "subject to all the
ills of the flesh, except possibly writer's paralysis and
housemaid's knee."
</p>

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Parasitic Infection Of Wild Ducks. </span> &mdash;The diseases of wild game, especially waterfowl, grouse and quail, have caused heavy losses in America as well as in European countries, and scientists have been carefully investigating the cause and the general nature of the maladies, as well as probable methods of prevention and cure. Mr. Geo. Atkinson, a well-known practical naturalist of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, writes as follows to a local paper on this subject, which I find quoted in the <i> National Sportsman</i>:
</p>
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
The question which has developed these important proportions during
the past year is that of the extent of the parasitic infection of
our wild ducks and other game, and the possibilities of the extended
transmission of these parasites to domestic stock, or even humanity,
by eating.
	</p>
	<p>
The parasites in question are contained in small elliptical cases
found underlying the surface muscles of the breast, and in advanced
cases extending deeper into the flesh and the muscular tissues of
the legs and wings. They are not noticeable in the ordinary process
of plucking the bird for the table, and are not found internally, so
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page87]
</span> </a> that the only method of discovering their presence is
by slitting the skin of the breast and paring it back a few inches
when the worm-like sacs will be seen buried in the flesh.
	</p>
	<p>
These parasites have come to my notice periodically during the
process of skinning birds for mounting during the past number of
years, but it was only when they appeared in unusual numbers last
fall that I made inquiries of the biological bureaus of Washington
and Ottawa for information of their life history and the
possibilities of their transmission to other hosts.
	</p>
	<p>
Replies from these sources surprised me with the information that
very little was known of the life history of any of the
Sarcosporidia, of which group this was a species. Nothing was known
of the method of infection or the transference from host to host or
species to species, and both departments asked for specimens for
examination.
	</p>
	<p>
Authorities are a unit in opinion that the question is one of great
importance to game conservation, and although opinions of the
dangers from eating differ somewhat, a record is given of a hog fed
upon affected flesh developing parasites in the muscles in six
weeks' time, while a case of a man's death from dropsy was found to
be the result of development of these parasites in the valves of the
heart.
	</p>
	<p>
The ability of these low forms of life to withstand extremes of heat
makes it necessary for more than ordinary cooking to be assured of
killing them, and since their presence is unnoted in the ordinary
course of dressing the birds for the table, there is little doubt
that very considerable numbers of these parasites are consumed at
our tables every season, with results at present unknown to us.
	</p>
	<p>
The species I have found most particularly infected have been
mallards, shovellers, teal, gadwall and pintails, and the birds,
outwardly in the best condition, have frequently been found loaded
with sacs of these parasites and only the turning back of the breast
skin can disclose their presence.
	</p>
</div>
<p>
The greatest slaughter of wild ducks by disease occurred on Great
Salt Lake, Utah. Until the "duck disease" (intestinal coccidiosis)
broke out there, in the summer of 1910, the annual market slaughter
of ducks at the mouth of Bear River had been enormous. When at Salt
Lake City in 1888 I made an effort to arouse the sportsmen whom I
met to the necessity of a reform, but my exhortations fell on deaf
ears. Naturally, the sweeping away of the remaining ducks by disease
would suggest a heaven-sent judgment upon the slaughterers were it
not for the fact that the last state of the unfortunate ducks is if
anything worse than the first.
</p>
<p>
On Oct. 17, 1911, the annual report of the chief of the Biological
Survey contained the following information on this subject:
</p>
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
<i> Epidemic Among Wild Ducks on Great Salt
Lake</i>.&mdash;Following a long dry season, which favored the
rearing of a large number of wild ducks, but materially reduced the
area of the feeding ponds, resulting in great overcrowding, a severe
epidemic broke out about August 1, 1910, among the wild ducks about
Great Salt Lake, Utah. Dead ducks could be counted by thousands
along the shores and the disease raged unabated until late fall.
Shooting clubs found it necessary to declare a closed season. Some
of the dead ducks were forwarded to the Biological Survey and were
turned over for examination to the Bureau of Animal Industry, by the
experts of which the disease was diagnosed as intestinal
coccidiosis.
	</p>
	<p>
Various plans of relieving the situation were tried. The irrigation
ditches were closed, thus providing the sloughs and ponds with fresh
water, and lime was sprinkled on the mud flats and duck trails.
Great improvement followed this treatment, and experiments proved
that ducks provided with abundant fresh water and clean food began
to recover immediately. These methods promised success, but later it
was proposed that the marshes be drained and exposed to the sun's
rays&mdash;a course which cannot be recommended. That coccidia are
not always killed by exposure to the sun is shown by their survival
on the sites of old chicken yards. An added disadvantage of the plan
is that draining and drying the marshes would have a bad effect on
the natural duck food, and upon the birds themselves.

	<div class="subtitle">
		DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY THE ELEMENTS
	</div>
</div>
<p>
It is a fixed condition of Nature that whenever and wherever a wild
species exists in a state of nature, free from the trammels and
limitations that contact with man always imposes, the species is
fitted to survive all ordinary climatic influences. Freedom of
action, and the exercise of several options in the line of
individual maintenance under stress, is essential to the welfare of
every wild species.
</p>
<p>
A prong-horned antelope herd that is free can drift before a
blizzard, can keep from freezing by the exercise, and eventually
come to shelter. Let that same herd drift against a barbed-wire
fence five miles long, and its whole scheme of self-preservation is
upset. The herd perishes then and there.
</p>
<p>
Cut out the undergrowth of a given section, drain the swamps and mow
down all the weeds and tall grass, and the next particularly hard
winter starves and freezes the quail.
</p>
<p>
Naturally the cutting of forests, clearing of brush and drainage of
marshes is more or less calamitous to all the species of birds that
inhabit such places and find there winter food and shelter.
Red-winged blackbirds and real estate booms can not inhabit the same
swamps contemporaneously. Before the relentless march of
civilization, the wild Indian, the bison and many of the wild birds
must inevitably disappear. We cannot change conditions that are as
inexorable as death itself. The wild life must either adjust itself
to the conditions that civilized man imposes upon it, or perish. I
say "civilized man," for the reason that the primitive races of man
are not deadly exterminators of species, as we are. I know of not
one species of wild life that has been exterminated by savage man
without the aid of his civilized peers.
</p>
<p>
As civilization marches ever onward, over the prairies, into the bad
lands and the forests, over the mountains and even into the farthest
corner of Death Valley, the desert of deserts, the struggle of the
wild birds, mammals and fishes is daily and hourly intensified. Man
must help them to maintain themselves, or accept a lifeless
continent. The best help consists in letting the wild creatures
throughly alone, so that they can help themselves; but quail often
need to be fed in critical periods. The best food is wheat
screenings placed under little tents of straw, bringing food and
shelter together.
</p>
<p>
In the well settled portions of the United States, such species as
quail, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, pinnated grouse and sage grouse
hang <a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page89] </span> </a> to life by slender threads. A winter of
exceptionally deep snows, much sleet, and a late spring always
causes grave anxiety among the state game wardens. In Pennsylvania a
very earnest movement is in progress to educate and persuade farmers
to feed the quail in winter, and much good is being done in that
direction.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Erasmus Wilson, of the <i> Pittsburgh Gazette-Times </i> is the
apostle of that movement.
</p>
<p>
<i> Quail should be fed every winter, in every northern state</i>.
The methods to be pursued will be mentioned elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
By way of illustration, here is a sample game report, from Las
Animas, Colorado, Feb. 22, 1912:
</p>
<p>
"After the most severe winter weather experienced for twenty years
we are able to compute approximately our loss of feathered life. It
is seventy-five per cent of the quail throughout the irrigated
district, and about twenty per cent of meadow-larks. In the rough
cedar-covered sections south of the Arkansas River, the loss among
the quail was much lighter. The ground sparrows suffered severely,
while the English sparrow seems to have come through in good shape.
Many cotton-tail rabbits starved to death, while the deep, light
snow of January made them easy prey for hawks and coyotes." (F.T.
Webber).
</p>
<p>
It would be possible to record many instances similar to the above,
but why multiply them? And now behold the cruel corollary:
</p>
<p>
At least twenty-five times during the past two years I have heard
and read arguments by sportsmen against my proposal for a 5-year
close season for quail, taking the ground that "The sportsmen are
not wholly to blame for the scarcity of quail. It is the cold
winters that kill them off!"
</p>
<p>
So then, <i> because the fierce winters murder the bob white,
wholesale, they should not have a chance to recover themselves</i>!
Could human beings possibly assume a more absurd attitude?
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is coldly and incontestably true, that even after such
winter slaughter as Mr. Webber has reported above, the very next
season will find the quail hunter joyously taking the field, his
face beaming with health and good living, to hunt down and shoot to
death as many as possible of the pitiful 25 per cent remnant that
managed to survive the pitiless winter. How many quail hunters,
think you, ever stayed their hands because of "a hard winter on the
quail?" I warrant not one out of every hundred! How many states in
this Union ever put on a close season because of a hard winter? I'll
warrant that not one ever did; and I think there is only one state
whose game commissioners have the power to act in that way without
recourse to the legislature. This situation is intolerable.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the splendid codified game laws enacted in New York state
in 1912, our Conservation Commission can declare a close season in
any locality, for any length of time, when the state of the game
demands an emergency measure. This act is as follows; and it is a
model law, which every other state should speedily enact:

<p>
I want all sensible, honest sportsmen to stop citing the killing of
game birds by severe winters <i> as a reason </i> why long close
seasons are not necessary, and why automatic guns "don't matter."
And I want sportsmen to consider their duty, and not go out hunting
any game species that has been slaughtered by a hard winter, until
it has had at least five years in which to recover. Any other course
is cruel, selfish, and shortsighted; and a word to the humane should
be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
The worst exhibitions ever made of the wolfish instinct to slay that
springs eternal in some human (!) breasts are those brought about
through the distress or errors of wild animals. By way of
illustration, consider the slaughter of half-starved elk that took
place in the edge of Idaho in the winter of 1909 and 1910, when
about seven hundred elk <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page91] </span> </a> that were driven out of the
Yellowstone Park at its northwestern corner by the deep snow, fled
into Idaho in the hope of finding food. The inhabitants met the
starving herds with repeating rifles, and as the unfortunate animals
struggled westward through the snow and storm, they were slaughtered
without mercy. Bulls and cows, old and young, all of the seven
hundred, went down; and Stoney Indians could not have acted any
worse than did those "settlers."
</p>
<p>
On another occasion, it is recorded that the prong-horned antelope
herd of the Mammoth Hot Springs wandered across the line into
Gardiner, and quickly met a savage attack of gunners with rifles. A
number of those rare and valuable animals were killed, and others
fled back into the Park with broken legs dangling in the air.
</p>
<p>
In the interest of public decency, and for the protection of the
reputation of American citizenship, one of two things should be
done. The northern boundary of the Park should be extended northward
beyond Gardiner, or else the deathtrap should be moved elsewhere.
The case of the town of Gardiner is referred to the legislature of
Montana for treatment.
</p>
<p>
Beyond question, the highest sentiments of humanity are those that
are stirred by the misfortunes of killable game. During the past
thirty years, I have noticed some interesting manifestations of the
increased sympathy for wild creatures that steadily is growing in a
large section of the public mind. Thirty years ago, the appearance
of a deer or moose in the streets of any eastern village nearly
always was in itself a signal for a grand chase of the unfortunate
creature, and its speedy slaughter. Today, in the eastern states,
the general feeling is quite different. The appearance of a deer in
the Hudson River itself, or a moose in a Maine village is a signal,
not for a wild chase and cruel slaughter, but for a general effort
to save the animal from being hurt, or killed. I know this through
ocular proof, at least half a dozen lost and bewildered deer having
been carefully driven into yards, or barns, and humanely kept and
cared for until they could be shipped to us. Several have been
caught while swimming in the Hudson, bewildered and panic-stricken.
The latest capture occurred in New York City itself.
</p>
<p>
A puma that escaped (about 1902) from the Zoological Park, instead
of being shot was captured by sensible people in the hamlet of
Bronxdale, alive and unhurt, and safely returned to us.
</p>
<p>
In some portions of the east, though not all, the day of the hue and
cry over "a wild animal in town" seems to be about over. On Long
Island some humane persons found an injured turkey vulture, and took
it in and cared for it,&mdash;only to be persecuted by ill-advised
game wardens, because they had a forbidden wild bird "in their
possession!" There are times when it is the highest (moral) duty of
a game warden to follow the advice of Private Mulvaney to the
"orficer boy," and "Shut yer oye to the rigulations, sorr!"
</p>
<p>
Such occurrences as these are becoming more and more common. <i> The
desire of "the great silent majority" is to SAVE the wild
creatures</i>; and it <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page92] </span> </a> is in response to that
sentiment that thousands of people are today in the field against
the Army of Destruction.
</p>
<p>
It is the duty of every sportsman to assist in promoting the passage
of a law like our New York law which empowers the State Game
Commission to throw extra protection around any species that has
been slaughtered too much by snow or by firearms, by closing the
open season as long as may be necessary. Can there be in all America
even one thinking, reasoning being who can not see the justice and
also the imperative necessity of this measure? It seems impossible.
</p>
<p>
Give the game the benefit of every doubt! If it becomes too thick,
your gun can quickly thin it out; but if it is once exterminated, it
will be impossible to bring it back. Be wise; and take thought for
the morrow. Remember the heath hen.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Slaughter Of Bluebirds. </span> &mdash;In the late winter and early spring of 1896 the wave of bluebirds was caught on its northward migration by a period of unseasonably cold and fearfully tempestuous weather, involving much icy-cold rain and sleet. Now, there is no other climatic condition that is so hard for a wild bird or mammal to withstand as rain at the freezing point, and a mantle of ice or frozen snow over all supplies of food.
</p>
<p>
The bluebirds perished by thousands. The loss occurred practically
all along their east-and-west line of migration, from Arkansas to
the Atlantic Coast. In places the species seemed almost
exterminated; and it was several years ere it recovered to a point
even faintly approximating its original population. I am quite
certain that the species never has recovered more than 50 per cent
of the number that existed previous to the calamity.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Duck Cholera In The Bronx River. </span> &mdash;In 1911, some unknown but new and particularly deadly element, probably introduced in sewage, contaminated the waters of Bronx River where it flows through New York City, with results very fatal in the Zoological Park. The large flock of mallard ducks, Canada geese, and snow geese on Lake Agassiz was completely wiped out. In all about 125 waterfowl died in rapid succession, from causes commonly classed under the popular name of "duck cholera." The disease was carried to other bodies of water in the Park that were fed from other sources, but made no headway elsewhere than on lakes fed by the polluted Bronx River.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the work of the Bronx River Parkway Commission soon will
terminate the present very unsanitary condition of that stream.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Wild Ducks In Distress. </span> &mdash;In the winter of 1911-12, many flocks of wild ducks decided to winter in the North. Many persons believe that this was largely due to the prevention of late winter and spring shooting; which seems reasonable. Unfortunately the winter referred to proved exceptionally severe and formed vast sheets of thick ice over the feeding-grounds where the ducks had expected to obtain their food. On Cayuga, Seneca and other lakes in central New York, and on the island of Martha's Vineyard, the flocks of ducks suffered very severely, and many <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page93] </span> </a> perished of hunger and cold. <i> But for the laws prohibiting late winter shooting undoubtedly all of them would have been shot and eaten, regardless of their distress</i>.
</p>
<p>
Game wardens and humane citizens made numerous efforts to feed the
starving flocks, and many ducks were saved in that way. An
illustrated article on the distressed ducks of Keuka Lake, by C.
William Beebe and Verdi Burtch, appeared in the <i> Zoological
Society Bulletin </i> for May, 1912. Fortunately there is every
reason to believe that such occurrences will be rare.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Wild Swans Swept Over Niagara Falls. </span> &mdash;During the past ten years, several winter tragedies to birds have occurred on a large scale at Niagara Falls. Whole flocks of whistling swans of from 20 up to 70 individuals alighting in the Niagara River above the rapids have permitted themselves to float down into the rapids, and be swept over the Falls, en masse. On each occasion, the great majority of the birds were drowned, or killed on the rocks. Of the very few that survived, few if any were able to rise and fly out of the gorge below the Falls to safety. It is my impression that about 200 swans recently have perished in this strange way.

		SLAUGHTER OF SONG-BIRDS BY ITALIANS
	</div>
</div>
<p>
In these days of wild-life slaughter, we hear much of death and
destruction. Before our eyes there continually arise photographs of
hanging masses of waterfowl, grouse, pheasants, deer and fish,
usually supported in true heraldic fashion by the men who slew them
and the implements of slaughter. The world has become somewhat
hardened to these things, because the victims are classed as game;
and in the destruction of game, one game-bag more or less "Will not
count in the news of the battle."
</p>
<p>
The slaughter of song, insectivorous and all other birds by Italians
and other aliens from southern Europe has become a scourge to the
bird life of this country. The devilish work of the negroes and poor
whites of the South will be considered in the next chapter. In
Italy, linnets and sparrows are "game"; and so is everything else
that wears feathers! Italy is a continuous slaughtering-ground for
the migratory birds of Europe, and as such it is an international
nuisance and a pest. The way passerine birds are killed and eaten in
that country is a disgrace to the government of Italy, and a
standing reproach to the throne. Even kings and parliaments have no
right in moral or international law to permit year after year the
wholesale slaughter of birds of passage of species that no civilized
man has a right to kill.
</p>
<p>
There are some tales of slaughter from which every properly-balanced
Christian mind is bound to recoil with horror. One such tale has
recently been given to us in the pages of the <i> Avicultural
Magazine</i>, of London, for January, 1912, by Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
F.Z.S., whose word no man will dispute. In condensing it, let us
call it
</p>
<div class="centerheading">
	The Italian Slaughter Of The Innocents
</div>
<p>
This story does not concern game birds of any kind. Quite the
contrary. That it should be published in America, a land now rapidly
filling up with Italians, is a painful necessity in order that the
people of America may be enabled accurately to measure the
fatherland traditions and the fixed mental attitude of Italians
generally toward our song birds. I shall now hold a mirror up to
Italian nature. If the image is either hideous or grotesque, the
fault will not be mine. I specially commend the picture to the
notice of American game wardens and judges on the bench.
</p>
<p>
The American reader must be reminded that the Italian peninsula
reaches out a long arm of land into the Mediterranean Sea for
several hundred miles toward the sunny Barbary coast of North
Africa. This great southward highway has been chosen by the birds of
central Europe as their favorite migration route. Especially is this
true of the small song-birds with weak wings and a minimum of power
for long-sustained flight. Naturally, they follow the peninsula down
to the Italian Land's End before they launch forth to dare the
passage of the Mediterranean.

<p>
Italy is the narrow end of a great continental funnel, into the wide
northern end of which Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland
annually pour their volume of migratory bird life. And what is the
result? For answer let us take the testimony of two reliable
witnesses, and file it for use on the day when Tony Macchewin, gun
in hand and pockets bulging with cartridges, goes afield in our
country and opens fire on our birds.
</p>
<p>
The linnet is one of the sweet singers of Europe. It is a small,
delicately formed, weak-winged little bird, about the size of our
phoebe-bird. It weighs only a trifle more than a girl's love-letter.
Where it breeds and rears its young, in Germany for example, a true
sportsman would no more think of shooting a linnet than he would of
killing and eating his daughter's dearest canary.
</p>
<p>
To the migrating bird, the approach to northern Italy, either going
or returning, is not through a land of plenty. The sheltering
forests have mostly been swept away, and safe shelters for small
birds are very rare. In the open, there are owls and hawks; and the
only refuge from either is the thick-leafed grove, into which
linnets and pipits can dive at the approach of danger and quickly
hide.
</p>
<p>
A linnet from the North after days of dangerous travel finally
reached Lake Como, southward bound. The country was much too open
for safety, and its first impulse was to look about for safe
shelter. The low bushes that sparsely covered the steep hillsides
were too thin for refuge in times of sudden danger.
</p>
<p>
Ah! Upon a hilltop is a little grove of trees, green and inviting.
In the grove a bird is calling, calling, insistently. The trees are
very small; but they seem to stand thickly together, and their
foliage should afford a haven from both hawk and gunner. To it
joyously flits the tired linnet. As it perches aloft upon a
convenient whip-like wand, it notices for the first time a queer,
square brick tower of small dimensions, rising in the center of a
court-yard surrounded by trees. The tower is like an old and dingy
turret that has been shorn from a castle, and set on the hilltop
without apparent reason. It is two stories in height, with one
window, dingy and uninviting. A door opens into its base.
</p>
<p>
Several birds that seem very near, but are invisible, frequently
call and chirp, as if seeking answering calls and companionship.
Surely the grove must be a safe place for birds, or they would not
be here.
</p>
<p>
Hark! A whirring, whistling sound fills the air, like the air tone
of a flying hawk's wings. A hawk! A hawk!
</p>
<p>
Down plunges the scared linnet, blindly, frantically, into the space
sheltered by the grove!
</p>
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page97] </span> </a>
<p>
Horrors! What is this?
</p>
<p>
Threads! Invisible, interlacing threads; tangled and full of
pockets, treacherously spanning the open space. It is a fowler's
net! The linnet is entangled. It flutters frantically but
helplessly, and hangs there, caught. Its alarm cry is frantically
answered by the two strange, invisible bird voices that come from
the top of the tower!
</p>
<p>
The grove and the tower are A ROCCOLO! A huge, permanent, merciless,
deadly <i> trap</i>, for the wholesale capture of songbirds! The
tower is the hiding place of the fowler, and the calling birds are
decoy birds whose eyes have been totally blinded by red-hot wires in
order that they will call more frantically than birds with eyes
would do. The whistling wings that seemed a hawk were a sham, made
by a racquet thrown through the air by the fowler, through a slot in
his tower. He keeps by him many such racquets.
</p>
<p>
The door of the tower opens, and out comes the fowler. He is
lowbrowed, swarthy, ill kept, and wears rings in his ears. A soiled
hand seizes the struggling linnet, and drags it violently from the
threads that entangled it. A sharp-pointed twig is thrust straight
through the head of the helpless victim <i> at the eyes</i>, and
after one wild, fluttering agony&mdash;it is dead.
</p>
<p>
The fowler sighs contentedly, re-enters his dirty and foul-smelling
tower, tosses the feathered atom upon the pile of dead birds that
lies upon the dirty floor in a dirty corner,&mdash;and is ready for
the next one.
</p>
<p>
Ask him, as did Mr. Astley, and he will tell you frankly that there
are about 150 dead birds in the pile,&mdash;starlings, sparrows,
linnets, greenfinches, chaffinches, goldfinches, hawfinches,
redstarts, blackcaps, robins, song thrushes, blackbirds, blue and
coal tits, fieldfares and redwings. He will tell you also, that
there are <i> seven other roccolos within sight and twelve within
easy walking distance</i>. He will tell you, as he did Mr. Astley,
that during that week he had taken about 500 birds, and that that
number was a fair average for each of the 12 other roccolos.
</p>
<p>
This means the destruction of about 5,000 songbirds per week <i> in
that neighborhood alone! </i> Another keeper of a roccolo told Mr.
Astley that during the previous autumn he took about 10,000 birds at
his small and comparatively insignificant roccolo.
</p>
<p>
And above that awful roccolo of slaughtered innocents rose <i> a
wooden cross</i>, in memory of Christ, the Merciful, the
Compassionate!
</p>
<p>
Around the interior of the entwined sapling tops that formed the
fatal bower of death there hung a semicircle of tiny cages
containing live decoys,&mdash;chaffinches, hawfinches, titmice and
several other species. "The older and staider ones call repeatedly,"
says Mr. Astley, "and the chaffinches break into song. It is the
only song to be heard in Italy at the time of the autum migration."
</p>
<p>
And the King of Italy, the Queen of Italy, the Parliament of Italy
and His Holiness the Pope permit these things, year in and year out.
It is now said, however, that through the efforts of a recently
organized <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page98] </span> </a> bird-lovers' society in Italy, the blinding
of decoy birds for roccolos is to be stopped.
</p>
<p>
In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, the protection of these birds
during their breeding season must be very effective, for otherwise
the supply for the Italian slaughter of the Innocents would long ago
have fallen to nothing.
</p>
<p>
The Germans love birds, and all wild life. I wonder how they like
the Italian roccolo. I wonder how France regards it; and whether the
nations of Europe north of Italy will endure this situation forever.
</p>
<p>
To the American and English reader, comment on the practices
recorded above is quite unnecessary, except the observation that
they betoken a callousness of feeling and a depth of cruelty and
destructiveness to which, so far as known, no savages ever yet have
sunk. As an exhibit of the groveling pusillanimity of the human
soul, the roccolo of northern Italy reveals minus qualities which
can not be expressed either in words or in figures.
</p>
<p>
And what is the final exhibit of the gallant knight of the roccolo,
the feudal lord of the modern castle and its retainers?
</p>
<p>
The answer is given by Dr. Louis B. Bishop, in an article on "Birds
in the Markets of Southern Europe."
</p>
<p>
In Venice, which was visited in October and November, during the
fall migration, he found on sale in the markets, as food, thousands
of songbirds.
</p>
<p>
"Birds were there in profusion, from ducks to kites, in the early
morning, hung in great bunches above the stalls, but by 9 A.M. most
of them had been sold. Ducks and shorebirds occurred in some
numbers, but the vast majority were small sparrows, larks and
thrushes. These were there during my visit by the thousands, if not
ten thousands. To the market they were brought in large sacks,
strung in fours on twigs which had been passed through the eyes and
then tied. Most of these small birds had been trapped, and on
skinning them I often could find no injury except at their eyes. <a
name="FNanchorC" id="FNanchorC"> </a> <a class="footnote-marker"
href="#Footnote_C"> [C] </a> One of these sacks which I examined on
November 3, contained hundreds of birds, largely siskins, skylarks
and bramblings. As a rule the small birds that were not sold in the
early morning were skinned or picked, and their tiny bodies packed
in regular order, breasts up, in shadow tin boxes, and exposed for
sale."
</p>
<p>
"During these visits to the Venetian markets, I identified 60
species, and procured specimens of most. As nearly as I can
remember, small birds cost from two to five cents apiece. For
example I paid $2.15 on Nov. 8, for

"In Florence," says Dr. Bishop, "I visited the central market on
November 26, 28, 29, 30, December 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and
found birds even more plentiful than in Venice." Besides a variety
of game birds, he found quantities of the species mentioned above,
seen in Venice, and also the following:

"Here, too [at Florence] we saw often, bunches and baskets of small
birds, chiefly redbreasts, hawked through the streets.... Every
Sunday that we went into the country we met numbers of Italians out
shooting, and their bags seemed to consist wholly of small birds.
</p>
<p>
"At Genoa, San Remo, Monte Carlo and Nice, between December 13 and
29, I did not visit the central markets, if such exist, but saw
frequently bunches of small birds hanging outside stores.... A
gentleman who spent the fall on an automobile trip through the west
of FRANCE <i> from Brittany to the Pyrenees, tells me he noticed
these bunches of small birds on sale in every town he visited</i>.
</p>

<p>
"That killing song-birds for food," continues Dr. Bishop, "is not
confined to the poor Italians I learned on October 27, when one of
the most prominent and wealthy Italian <i>
ornithologists</i>&mdash;a delightful man&mdash;told me he had shot
180 skylarks and pipits the day before, and that his family liked
them far better than other game. Our prejudice against selling game
does not exist in Europe, and this same ornithologist told me he
often shot 200 ducks in a day at his shooting-box, sending to the
market what he could not use himself. On November 1, 1910, he shot
82 ducks, and on November 8, 103, chiefly widgeon and teal."
</p>
<p>
An "ornithologist" indeed! A "sportsman" also, is he not? He belongs
with his brother "ornithologists" of the roccolos, who net their
"game" with the aid of <i> blind </i> birds! Brave men, gallant
"sportsmen," are these men of Italy,&mdash;and western France also
if the tale is true!
</p>
<p>
If the people of Europe can stand the wholesale, systematic
slaughter of their song and insectivorous birds, <i> we can</i>! If
they are too mean-spirited to rise up, make a row about it, and stop
it, then let them pay the price; but, by the Eternal, Antonio shall
not come to this country with the song-bird tastes of the roccolo
and indulge them here!
</p>
<p>
The above facts have been cited, not at all for the benefit of
Europe, but for our own good. The American People are now confronted
by the Italian and Austrian and Hungarian laborer and saloon-keeper
and mechanic, and all Americans should have an exact measure of the
sentiments of southern Europe toward our wild life generally,
especially the birds that we do not shoot at all, <i> and therefore
are easy to kill</i>.
</p>
<p>
When a warden or a citizen arrests an alien for killing any of our
non-game birds, show the judge these records of how they do things
in Italy, and ask for the extreme penalty.
</p>
<p>
I have taken pains to publish the above facts from eye-witnesses in
order that every game commissioner, game warden and state legislator
who reads these pages may know exactly what he is "up against" in
the alien population of our country from southern Europe. For
unnumbered generations, the people of Italy have been taught to
believe that it is <i> perfectly right </i> to shoot and devour
every song-bird that flies. The Venetian is no respecter of species;
and when an Italian "ornithologist" (!) can go out and murder 180
linnets and pipits in one day for the pot, it is time for Americans
to think hard.
</p>
<p>
We sincerely hope that it will not require blows and kicks and fines
to remove from Antonio's head the idea that America is not Italy,
and that the slaughter of song birds "don't go" in this country. I
strongly recommend to every state the enactment of a law that will
do these things:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		&mdash;Prohibit the owning, carrying or use of firearms by aliens, and
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Prohibit the use of firearms in hunting by any naturalized alien from southern Europe until after a 10-years' residence in America.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
From reports that have come to me at first hand regarding Italians
in the East, Hungarians in Pennsylvania and Austrians in Minnesota,
it seems absolutely certain that all members of the lower classes of
southern Europe are a dangerous menace to our wild life.
</p>
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page101] </span> </a>
<p>
On account of the now-accursed land-of-liberty idea, every foreigner
who sails past the statue on Bedloe's Island and lands on our
liberty-ridden shore, is firmly convinced that <i> now, at last</i>,
he can do as he pleases! And as one of his first ways in which to
show his newly-acquired personal liberty and independence in the
Land of Easy Marks, he buys a gun and goes out to shoot "free game!"
</p>
<p>
If we, as a people, are so indolent and so somnolent that Antonio
gets away with all our wild birds, then do we deserve to be robbed.
</p>
<p>
Italians are pouring into America in a steady stream. They are
strong, prolific, persistent and of tireless energy. New York City
now contains 340,000 of them. They work while the native Americans
sleep. Wherever they settle, their tendency is to root out the
native American and take his place and his income. Toward wild life
the Italian laborer is a human mongoose. Give him power to act, and
he will quickly exterminate every wild thing that wears feathers or
hair. To our songbirds he is literally a "pestilence that walketh at
noonday".
</p>
<p>
As we have shown, the Italian is a born pot-hunter, and he has grown
up in the fixed belief that killing song-birds for food is right! To
him all is game that goes into the bag. The moment he sets foot in
the open, he provides himself with a shot-gun, and he looks about
for things to kill. It is "a free country;" therefore, he may kill
anything he can find, cook it and eat it. If anybody attempts to
check him,&mdash;sapristi! beware his gun! He cheerfully invades
your fields, and even your lawn; and he shoots robins, bluebirds,
thrushes, catbirds, grosbeaks, tanagers, orioles, woodpeckers,
quail, snipe, ducks, crows, and herons.
</p>
<p>
Down in Virginia, near Charlottesville, an Italian who was working
on a new railroad once killed a turkey buzzard; and he selfishly
cooked it and ate it, all alone. A pot-hunting compatriot of his
heard of it, and reproached him for having-dined on game in camera.
In the quarrel that ensued, one of the "sportsmen" stabbed the other
to death.
</p>
<p>
When the New York Zoological Society began work on its Park in 1899,
the northern half of the Borough of the Bronx was a regular daily
hunting-ground for the slaughter of song-birds, and all other birds
that could be found. Every Sunday it was "bangetty!" "bang!" from
Pelham Bay to Van Cortlandt. The police force paid not the slightest
attention to these open, flagrant, shameless violations of the city
ordinances and the state bird laws. In those days I never but once
heard of a policeman <i> on his own initiative </i> arresting a
birdshooter, even on Sunday; but whenever meddlesome special wardens
from the Zoological Park have pointedly called upon the local police
force for help, it has always been given with cheerful alacrity. In
the fall of 1912 an appeal to the Police Commissioner resulted in a
general order to stop all hunting and shooting in the Borough of the
Bronx, and a reform is now on.
</p>
<p>
The war on the bird-killers in New York City began in 1900. It
seemed that if the Zoological Society did not take up the matter,
the slaughter would continue indefinitely. The white man's burden
was taken up; and <a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page102] </span> </a> the story of the war is
rather illuminating. Mr. G.O. Shields, President of the League of
American Sportsmen, quickly became interested in the matter, and
entered actively into the campaign. For months unnumbered, he spent
every Sunday patroling the woods and thickets of northern New York
and Westchester county, usually accompanied by John J. Rose and
Rudolph Bell of the Zoological Park force, for whom appointments as
deputy game wardens had been secured from the State.
</p>
<p>
The adventures of that redoubtable trio of man-hunters would make an
interesting chapter. They were shot at by poachers, but more
frequently they shot at the other fellows. Just why it was that no
one was killed, no one seems to know. Many Italians and several
Americans were arrested while hunting, haled to court, prosecuted
and fined. Finally, a reign of terror set in; and that was the
beginning of the end. It became known that those three men could not
be stopped by threats, and that they always got their
man&mdash;unless he got into a human rabbit-warren of the Italian
boarding-house species. That was the only escape that was possible.
</p>
<p>
The largest haul of dead birds was 43 robins, orioles, thrushes and
woodpeckers, captured along with the five Italians who committed the
indiscretion of sitting down in the woods to divide their dead
birds. We saved all the birds in alcohol, and showed them in court.
The judge fined two of the Italians $50 each, and the other three
were sent to the penitentiary for two months each.
</p>
<p>
Even yet, however, at long intervals an occasional son of sunny
Italy tries his luck at Sunday bird shooting; but if anyone yells at
him to "Halt!" he throws away his gun and stampedes through the
brush like a frightened deer. The birds of upper New York are now
fairly secure; but it has taken ten years of fighting to bring it
about.
</p>
<p>
Throughout New York State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, and even Minnesota, wherever there are large
settlements of Italians and Hungarians, the reports are the same.
They swarm through the country every Sunday, and shoot every wild
thing they see. Wherever there are large construction
works,&mdash;railroads, canals or aqueducts,&mdash;look for bird
slaughter, and you are sure to find it. The exception to this rule,
so far as I know, is along the line of the new Catskill aqueduct,
coming to New York City. The contractors have elected not to permit
bird slaughter, and the rule has been made that any man who goes out
hunting will instantly be discharged. That is the best rule that
ever was made for the protection of birds and game against
gang-working aliens.
</p>
<p>
Let every state and province in America look out sharply for the
bird-killing foreigner; for sooner or later, he will surely attack
your wild life. The Italians are spreading, spreading, spreading. If
you are without them to-day, to-morrow they will be around you. Meet
them at the threshold with drastic laws, throughly enforced; for no
half way measures will answer.
</p>
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page103] </span> </a>
<p>
Pennsylvania has had the worst experience of alien slaughterers of
any state, thus far. <i> Six </i> of her game wardens have been <i>
killed</i>, and eight or ten have been wounded, by shooting! Finally
her legislature arose in wrath, and passed a law prohibiting the
ownership or possession of guns of any kind by aliens. The law gives
the right of domiciliary search, and it surely is enforced. Of
course the foreign population "kicked" against the law, but the
People's steam roller went over them just the same. In New York, we
require from an alien a license costing $20, and it has saved a
million (perhaps) of our birds; but the Pennsylvania law is the
best. It may be taken as a model for every state and province in
America. Its text is as follows:
</p>
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
Section I. Be it enacted, &amp;c., That from and after the passage
of this act, it shall be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born
resident to hunt for or capture or kill, in this Commonwealth, any
wild bird or animal, either game or otherwise, of any description,
excepting in defense of person or property; and to that end it shall
be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born resident, within this
Commonwealth, to either own or be possessed of a shotgun or rifle of
any make. Each and every person violating any provision of this
section shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a
penalty of twenty-five dollars for each offense, or undergo
imprisonment in the common jail of the county for the period of one
day for each dollar of penalty imposed. Provided, That in addition
to the before-named penalty, all guns of the before-mentioned kinds
found in possession or under control of an unnaturalized
foreign-born resident shall, upon conviction of such person, or upon
his signing a declaration of guilt as prescribed by this act, be
declared forfeited to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and shall be
sold by the Board of Game Commissioners as hereinafter directed.
	</p>
	<p>
Section 2. For the purpose of this act, any unnaturalized
foreign-born person who shall reside or live within the boundaries
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for ten consecutive days shall
be considered a resident and shall be liable to the penalties
imposed for violation of the provisions of this act.
	</p>
	<p>
Section 3. That the possession of a shotgun or rifle at any place
outside of a building, within this Commonwealth, by an unnaturalized
foreign-born resident, shall be conclusive proof of a violation of
the provisions of section one of this act, and shall render any
person convicted thereof liable to the penalty as fixed by said
section.
	</p>
	<p>
Section 4. That the presence of a shotgun or rifle in a room or
house, or building or tent, or camp of any description, within this
Commonwealth, occupied by or controlled by an unnaturalized
foreign-born resident shall be prima facie evidence that such gun is
owned or controlled by the person occupying or controlling the
property in which such gun is found, and shall render such person
liable to the penalty imposed by section one of this act.
	</p>
</div>
<p>
Other sections provide for the full enforcement of this law.
</p>
<p>
It is now high time, and an imperative public necessity, that every
state should act in this matter, before its bird life is suddenly
attacked, and serious inroads made upon it. Do it NOW! The enemy is
headed your way. Don't wait for him to strike the first blow!
</p>
<p>
<i> Duty of the Italian Press and Clergy</i>.&mdash;Now what is the
best remedy for the troubles that will arise for Italians in America
because of wrong principles established in Italy? It is not in the
law, the police, the court and the punishment. It is in <i>
educating the Italian into a knowledge of the duties of the good
citizen</i>! The Italian press and clergy can do this; and <i> no
one else can do it so easily, so quickly and so well</i>!
</p>
<p>
Those two powerful forces should enter seriously upon this task. In
every other respect, the naturalized Italian tries to become a good
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page104]
</span> </a> citizen, and adjust himself to the laws and the customs
of his new country. Why should he not do this in regard to bird
life? It is not too much to ask, nor is it too much to <i>
exact</i>. Does the Italian workman, or store-keeper who makes his
living by honest toil <i> enjoy </i> breaking our bird laws, <i>
enjoy </i> irritating and injuring those with whom he has come to
live? Does he <i> enjoy </i> being watched, and searched, and
chased, and arrested,&mdash;all for a few small birds that he <i>
does not need </i> for food? He earns good wages; he has plenty of
good food; and he must be <i> educated </i> into protecting our
birds instead of destroying them. The Italian newspapers and clergy
have a serious duty to perform in this matter, and we hope they will
diligently discharge it.

		DESTRUCTION OF SONG BIRDS BY SOUTHERN NEGROES AND POOR WHITES
	</div>
</div>
<p>
Before going farther, there is one point that I wish to make quite
clear.
</p>
<p>
Whenever the people of a particular race make a specialty of some
particular type of wrong-doing, anyone who pointedly rebukes the
faulty members of that race is immediately accused of "race
prejudice." On account of the facts I am now setting forth about the
doings of Italian and negro bird-killers, I expect to be accused
along that line. If I am, I shall strenuously deny the charge. The
facts speak for themselves. Zoologically, however, I am strongly
prejudiced against the people of any race, creed, club, state or
nation who make a specialty of any particularly offensive type of
bird or wild animal slaughter; and I do not care who knows it.
</p>
<p>
The time was, and I remember it very well, when even the poorest
gunner scorned to kill birds that were not considered "game." In
days lang syne, many a zoological collector has been jeered because
the specimens he had killed for preservation were not "game."
</p>
<p>
But times have changed. In the wearing of furs, we have bumped down
steps both high and steep. In 1880 American women wore sealskin,
marten, otter, beaver and mink. To-day nothing that wears hair is
too humble to be skinned and worn. To-day "they are wearing" skins
of muskrats, foxes, rabbits, skunks, domestic cats, squirrels, and
even rats. And see how the taste for game,&mdash;of some sections of
our population,&mdash;also has gone down.
</p>
<p>
In the North, the Italians are fighting for the privilege of eating
everything that wears feathers; but we allow no birds to be shot for
food save game birds and cranes. In the South, the negroes and poor
whites are killing song-birds, woodpeckers and doves for food; and
in several states some of it is done under the authority of the
laws. Look at these awful lists:

<p>
The killing of doves represents a great and widespread decline in
the ethics of sportsmanship. In the twenty-six States named, a great
many men who <i> call </i> themselves sportsmen indulge in the cheap
and ignoble pastime of potting weak and confiding doves. It is on a
par with the "sport" of hunting English sparrows in a city street.
Of course this is, to a certain extent, a matter of taste; but there
is at least one club of sportsmen into which no dove-killer can
enter, provided his standard of ethics is known in advance.
</p>
<p>
With the killing of robins, larks, blackbirds and cedar birds for
food, the case is quite different. No white man calling himself a
sportsman ever indulges in such low pastimes as the killing of such
birds for food. That burden of disgrace rests upon the negroes and
poor whites of the South; but at the same time, it is a shame that
respectable white men sitting in state legislatures should
deliberately enact laws <i> permitting </i> such disgraceful
practices, or permit such disgraceful and ungentlemanly laws to
remain in force!
</p>
<p>
Here is a case by way of illustration, copied very recently from the
Atlanta <i> Journal</i>:
</p>
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
Editor <i> Journal</i>:&mdash;I located a robin roost up the Trinity
River, six miles from Dallas, and prevailed on six Dallas sportsmen
to go with me on a torch-light bird hunt. This style of hunting was,
of course, new to the Texans, but they finally consented to go, and
I had the pleasure of showing them how it was done.
	</p>
	<p>
Equipped with torch lights and shot guns, we proceeded. After
reaching the hunting grounds the sport began in reality, and
continued for two hours and ten minutes, with a total slaughter of
10,157 birds, an average of 1,451 birds killed by each man.
	</p>
	<p>
But the Texans give me credit for killing at least 2,000 of the
entire number. I was called 'the king of bird hunters' by the
sportsmen of Dallas, Texas, and have been invited to
command-in-chief the next party of hunters which go from Dallas to
the Indian Territory in search of large game.&mdash;F.L. CROW,

As a further illustration of the spirit manifested in the South
toward robins, I quote the following story from Dr. P.P. Claxton, of
the University of Tennessee, as related in Audubon Educational
Leaflet No. 46, by Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The roost to which I refer," says Professor Claxton, "was situated
in what is locally known as a 'cedar glade,' near Porestville,
Bedford Co., Tennessee. This is a great cedar country, and robins
used to come in immense numbers during the winter months, to feed on
the berries.
</p>
<p>
"The spot which the roost occupied was not unlike numerous others
that might have been selected. The trees grew to a height of from
five to thirty feet, and for a mile square were literally loaded at
night with robins. Hunting them while they roosted was a favorite
sport. A man would climb a cedar tree with a torch, while his
companions with poles and clubs would disturb the sleeping birds on
the adjacent trees. Blinded by the light, the suddenly awakened
birds flew to the torch-bearer; who, <i> as he seized each bird
would quickly pull off its head</i>, and drop it into a sack
suspended from his shoulders.

"The capture of three of four hundred birds was an ordinary night's
work. Men and boys would come in wagons from all the adjoining
counties and camp near the roost for the purpose of killing robins.
Many times, <a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page108] </span> </a> 100 or more hunters with torches and clubs
would be at work in a single night. <i> For three years </i> this
tremendous slaughter continued in winter,&mdash;and then the
survivors deserted the roost."
</p>
<p>
No: these people were not Apache Indians, led by a Geronimo who knew
no mercy, no compassion. We imagine that they were mostly poor white
trash, of Tennessee. One small hamlet sent to market annually enough
dead robins to return $500 at <i> five cents per dozen</i>; which
means <i> 120,000 birds</i>!
</p>
<p class="clearall">
	Last winter Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny of Avery Island, La. (south of New Iberia) informed me that every winter, during the two weeks that the holly berries are ripe thousands of robins come to his vicinity to feed upon them. "Then every negro man and boy who can raise a gun is after them. About 10,000 robins are slaughtered each day while they remain. Their dead bodies are sold in New Iberia at 10 cents each." The accompanying illustrations taken by Mr. McIlhenny shows 195 robins on one tree, and explains how such great slaughter is possible.

	<span class="title"> Special Work Of The Southern Negroes. </span> &mdash;In 1912 a female colored servant who recently had arrived from country life in Virginia chanced to remark to me at our country home in the middle of August: "I wish I could find some birds' nests!"
</p>
<p>
"What for?" I asked, rather puzzled.
</p>
<p>
"Why, to get the aigs and <i> eat 'em!</i>" she responded with a
bright smile and flashing teeth.
</p>
<p>
"Do you eat the eggs of <i> wild </i> birds?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes indeed! It's <i> fine </i> to get a pattridge nest! From them
we nearly always git a whole dozen of aigs at once,&mdash;back where
I live, in Virginia."
</p>
<p>
"Do the colored people of Virginia make a <i> practice </i> of
hunting for the eggs of wild birds, and eating them?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, indeed we do. In the spring and summer, when the birds are
around, we used to get out every Sunday, and hunt all day. Some days
we'd come back with a whole bucket full of aigs; and then we'd set
up half the night, cookin' and eatin' 'em. They was <i> awful </i>
good!"
</p>
<p>
Her face fairly beamed at the memory of it.
</p>
<p>
A few days later, this story of the doings of Virginia negroes was
fully corroborated by a colored man who came from another section of
that state. Three months later, after special inquiries made at my
request, a gentleman of Richmond obtained further corroboration,
from negroes. He was himself much surprised by the state of fact
that was revealed to him.
</p>
<p>
In the North, the economic value of our song birds and other
destroyers of insects and weed seeds is understood by a majority of
the people, and as far as possible those birds are protected from
all human enemies. But in the South, a new division of the Army of
Destruction has risen into deadly prominence.
</p>
<p>
In <i> Recreation </i> Magazine for May, 1909, Mr. Charles Askins
published a most startling and illuminating article, entitled "The
South's Problem in Game Protection." It brought together in concrete
form and with eye-witness reliability the impressions that for
months previous had been gaining ground in the North. In order to
give the testimony of a man who has seen what he describes, I shall
now give numerous quotations from Mr. Askins' article, which
certainly bears the stamp of truthfulness, without any "race
prejudice" whatever. It is a calm, judicial, unemotional analysis of
a very bad situation: and I particularly commend it alike to the
farmers of the North and all the true sportsmen of the South.
</p>
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page110] </span> </a>
<p>
In his opening paragraphs Mr. Askins describes game and hunting
conditions in the South as they were down to twenty years ago, when
the negroes were too poor to own guns, and shooting was not for
them.
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p class="centerheading">
		SPECIAL WORK OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES.
	</p>
	<p>
It is all different now, says Mr. Askins, and the old days will only
come back with the water that has gone down the stream. The master
is with his fathers or he is whiling away his last days on the
courthouse steps of the town. Perhaps a chimney or two remain of
what was once the "big house" on the hill; possibly it is still
standing, but as forlorn and lifeless as a dead tree. The muscadine
grapes still grow in the swale and the persimmons in the pasture
field, but neither 'possum nor 'coon is left to eat them. The last
deer vanished years ago, the rabbits died in their baby coats and
the quail were killed in June. Old "Uncle Ike" has gone across the
"Great River" with his master, and his grandson glances at you
askance, nods sullenly, whistles to his half breed bird dog,
shoulders his three dollar gun and leaves you. He is typical of the
change and has caused it, this grandson of dear old Uncle Ike.
	</p>
	<p>
In the same way the white man is telling the black to abide upon the
plantation raising cotton and corn, and further than this nothing
will be required of him. He can cheat a white man or a black, steal
in a petty way anything that comes handy, live in marriage or out of
it to please himself, kill another negro if he likes, and lastly
shoot every wild thing that can be eaten, if only he raises the
cotton and the corn. But the white sportsmen of the South have never
willingly granted the shooting privilege in its entirety, and hence
this story. They have told him to trap the rabbits, pot the robins,
slaughter the doves, kill the song birds, but to spare the white
sportsman's game, the aristocratic little bobwhite quail.
	</p>
	<p>
In the beginning not so much damage to southern game interests could
be accomplished by our colored man and brother, however decided his
inclinations. He had no money, no ammunition and no gun. His weapons
were an ax, a club, a trap, and a hound dog; possibly he might own
an old war musket bored out for shot. Such an outfit was not adapted
to quail shooting and especially to wing shooting, with which
knowledge Dixie's sportsmen were content. Let the negro ramble about
with his hound dog and his war musket; he couldn't possibly kill the
quail. And so Uncle Ike's grandson loafed and pottered about in the
fields with his ax and his hound dogs, not doing so much harm to the
quail but acquiring knowledge of the habits of the birds and skill
as a still-hunting pot-hunter that would serve him well later on.
The negro belongs to a primitive race of people and all such races
have keener eyes than white men whose fathers have pored over lines
of black and white. He learned to see the rabbit in its form, the
squirrels in the leafy trees, and the quails huddled in the grass.
The least shade of gray in the shadow of the creek bank he
distinguished at once as a rabbit, a glinting flash from a tree top
he knew instantly as being caused by the slight movement of a hidden
squirrel, and the quiver of a single stem of sedge grass told him of
a bevy of birds hiding in the depths. The pot-hunting negro has all
the skill of the Indian, has more industry in his loafing, and kills
without pity and without restraint. This grandson of Uncle Ike was
growing sulky, too, with the knowledge that the white man was
bribing him with half a loaf to raise cotton and corn when he might
as well exact it all. And this he shortly did, as we shall see.
	</p>
	<p>
The time came when cotton went up to sixteen cents a pound and
single breech-loading guns went down to five dollars apiece. The
negro had money now, and the merchants&mdash;these men who had said
let the nigger alone so long as he raises cotton and corn&mdash;sold
him the guns, a gun for every black idler, man and boy, in all the
South. Then shortly a wail went up from the sportsmen, "The niggers
are killing our quail." They not only were killing them, but most of
the birds were already dead. On the grounds of the Southern Field
Club where sixty bevies were raised by the dogs in one day, within
two years but three bevies could be found in a day by the hardest
kind of hunting; and this story was repeated all over the South. Now
the negro began to raise bird dogs in place of hounds, and he
carried his new gun to church if services happened to be held on a
week day. Finally the negro had grown up and had compassed his
ambition: he could shoot partridges flying just the same as a white
man, was a white man except for a trifling difference in color; and
he could kill more birds, too, three times as many. It was merely a
change from the old order to the new in which a dark-skinned
"sportsman" had taken the place in plantation life of the dear old
"Colonel" of loved memory. The negro had exacted his price for
raising cotton and corn.

<div class="blockmiddle">
	<p>
Our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times, but especially so
in the matter of recreation. He may slouch about alone and pot a
bevy or two of quail when in actual need of something to eat, or
when he has a sale for the birds, but when it comes to shooting for
fun he wants to be with the "gang." I have seen the darkies at
Christmas time collect fifty in a drove with every man his dog, and
spread out over the fields. Such a glorious time as he has then! A
single cottontail will draw a half-dozen shots and perhaps a couple
of young bucks will pour loads into a bunny after he is dead out of
pure deviltry and high spirits. I once witnessed the accidental
killing of a young negro on this kind of a foray. His companions
loaded him into a wagon, stuck a cigar in his mouth, and tried to
pour whiskey down him every time they took a drink themselves as
they rode back to town. This army of black hunters and their dogs
cross field after field, combing the country with fine teeth that
leave neither wild animal nor bird life behind.
	</p>
	<p>
There comes a time toward the spring of the year after the quail
season is over when the average rural darky is "between hay and
grass." The merchants on whom he has depended for supplies make it a
practice to refuse credit between January first and crop time. The
black has spent his cotton money, his sweet potato pile has
vanished, the sorghum barrel is empty, he has eaten the last of his
winter's pork, and all that remains is a bit of meal and the meat
his gun can secure. He is hunting in grim earnest now, using all the
cunning and skill acquired by years of practice. He eats
woodpeckers, jaybirds, hawks and skunks, drawing the line only at
crows and buzzards. At this season of the year I have carried
chicken hawks up to the cabins for the sake of watching the delight
of the piccaninnies who with glowing eyes would declare, "Them's
mos' as good as chicken." What happens to the robins, doves, larks,
red birds, mocking birds and all songsters in this hungry season
needs hardly to be stated.
	</p>
	<p>
It is also a time between hay and grass for the rabbits and the
quail. The corn fields are bare and the weed seeds are exhausted. A
spring cold spell pinches, they lose their vitality, become thin and
quite lack their ordinary wariness. Then the figure-four trap
springs up in the hedgerow and the sedge while the work of
decimation goes more rapidly along. The rabbits can no longer escape
the half-starved dogs, the thinning cover fails to hide the quail
and the song birds betray themselves by singing of the coming
spring.
	</p>
	<p>
With the growing scarcity of the game now comes the season of sedge
and field burning. This is done ostensibly to prepare the land for
spring plowing, but really to destroy the last refuge of the quail
and rabbits so that they can be bagged with certainty. All the
negroes of a neighborhood collect for one of these burnings, all
their dogs, and of course all the boys from six years old up. They
surround the field and set it on fire in many places, leaving small
openings for the game to dash out among the motley assembly. I have
seen quail fly out of the burning grass with flaming particles still
attached to them. They alight on the burnt ground too bewildered to
fly again and the boys and dogs pick them up. Crazed rabbits try the
gauntlet amidst the barking curs, shouting negroes and popping guns,
but death is sure and quick. The few quail that may escape have no
refuge from the hawks and nothing to eat, so every battue of this
kind marks the absolute end of the birds in one vicinity; and the
next day the darkies repeat the performance elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
At this season of the year, the first of May, the blacks are putting
in some of their one hundred working days while the single
breech-loader rusts in the chimney corner. Surely the few birds that
have escaped the foray of the "gang," lived through the hungry days,
and survived their burned homes can now call "Bob White" and mate in
peace. But school is out and the summer sun is putting new life into
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page113]
</span> </a> the bare feet of the half-grown boys, and the halfbreed
bird dogs are busier than they were even in winter. The young
rabbits are killed before they get out of the nest, and the quail
eggs must be hidden rarely well that escape both the eyes of the
boys and the noses of the dogs. After all it is not surprising that
but three bevies remained of the sixty. Doubtless they would not,
except that nature is very kind to her own in the sunny South.
	</p>
	<p>
Not every white man in the South is a sportsman or even a shooter;
many are purely business men who have said let the "nigger" do as he
likes so long as he raises cotton and buys our goods. But Dixie has
her full share of true men of the out-of-doors and they have sworn
in downright Southern fashion that this thing has got to end.
Nevertheless their problem is deep and puzzling. In Alabama they
made an effort and a beginning. They asked for a law requiring every
man to obtain written permission before entering the lands of
another to hunt and shoot; they asked for a resident license law
taxing every gun not less than five dollars a year; for a shortened
season, a bag limit, and a complete system of State wardens.
Unfortunately, a lot of white farmers were in the same range as the
blacks, and being hit, too, they raised a great outcry. The result
was that the Alabama sportsmen got everything they asked for except
the foundation of the structure they were trying to build, the high
resident license or gun tax which alone could have shut out three
dollar guns and saved the remnant of the game. Under the new law the
sale of game was forbidden, neither could it be shipped out of the
State alive or dead; the ever popular non-resident license was
provided for; the season was shortened and the bag limited; the
office of State game warden was created with deputies to be paid
from fines; hunting upon the lands of another without written
permission became a misdemeanor; and then the whole thing was
nullified by reducing the resident license to nothing where a man
shot upon his own land, one dollar in his own county, and two
dollars outside of it. In its practical workings the new law amounts
to this: A few northern gunners have paid the non-resident license
fee, and enough resident licenses have been taken out by the city
sportsmen to make up the handsome salary of the State warden. The
negro still hunts upon his own land <i> or upon the land of the man
who wants corn and cotton raised</i>, with perfect indifference to
the whole thing. Who was to enforce the law against him? Not the one
disgusted deputy with three big counties to patrol who depended for
his salary upon the fines collected from the negroes. It would take
one man to every three miles square to protect the game in the
South.
	</p>
	<p>
The one effective way of dealing with the situation in Alabama was
to have legislated three dollar guns out of existence with a five
dollar tax, adding to this nearly a like amount on dogs. Hardly a
sportsman in the South will disagree with this conclusion. But
sportsmen never had a majority vote either in the South or in the
North, and the South's grave problem is yet unsolved.
	</p>
	<p>
I do not favor depriving the black man of his natural human right to
hunt and shoot. If he is the owner of land, or if he leases or rents
it, or if he does not, he should have exactly the same privilege of
hunting that the white man has. That is not the question now,
however, but how to restrict him to legal shooting, to make him
amenable to the law that governs the white man, to deprive him of
the absolute license he now enjoys to kill throughout the year
without mercy, without discrimination, without restraint. If only
for selfish reasons, we of the North should reach to southern
sportsmen a helping hand, for by and by the last of our migratory
song birds will go down into Dixie and never return.
	</p>
</div>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p>
Mr. Askins has fairly stated a profoundly disturbing case. The
remedy must contain at least three ingredients. The sportsmen of the
South must stop the unjustifiable slaughter of their non-migratory
game birds. As a matter of comity between states, the gentlemen of
the South must pass laws to stop the killing of northern song-birds
and all crop-protecting birds, for food. Finally, all men, North and
South, East and West, must unite in the work that is necessary to
secure the immediate enactment by Congress of a law for the federal
protection of all migratory birds.

		EXTERMINATION OF BIRDS FOR WOMEN'S HATS <a name="FNanchorD" id="FNanchorD"> </a> <a class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_D"> [D] </a>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
It is high time for the whole civilized world to know that many of
the most beautiful and remarkable birds of the world are now being
<i> exterminated </i> to furnish millinery ornaments for women's
wear. The mass of new information that we have recently secured on
this traffic from the headquarters of the feather trade is
appalling. Previously, I had not dreamed that conditions are half as
bad as they are.
</p>
<p>
It is entirely fitting that on this subject New York should send a
message to London. New York is almost a Spotless Town in plume-free
millinery, and London and Paris are the worst places in the world.
We have cleaned house. With but extremely slight exceptions, the
blood of the slaughtered innocents is no longer upon our skirts, and
on the subject of plumage millinery we have a right to be just as
Pharisaical as we choose.
</p>
<p>
Here in New York (and also in New Jersey) no man may sell, own for
sale or offer for sale the plumage of any wild American bird other
than a game bird. More than that, the plumage of no foreign bird
belonging to any bird family represented in the fauna of North
America can be sold here! There are only a few kinds of improper
"millinery" feathers that it is possible to sell here under the law.
Thanks to the long and arduous campaign of the National Association
of Audubon Societies, founded and for ten years directed by gallant
William Dutcher, you now see on the streets of New York very, very
little wild-bird plumage save that from game birds.
</p>
<p>
It is true that a few servant girls are now wearing the cast-off
aigrettes of their mistresses; but they are only as one in a
thousand. At Atlantic City there is said to be a fine display of
servant-girl and ladies-maid aigrettes. In New York and New Jersey,
in Pennsylvania for everything save the sale of heron and egret
plumes (a privilege obtained by a bunko game), in Massachusetts, and
in many other of our States, the wild-birds'-plumage millinery
business is dead. Two years ago, when the New York legislature
refused to repeal the Dutcher law, the Millinery Association
asserted, and brought a cloud of witnesses to Albany to prove, that
the enforcement of the law would throw thousands of operatives out
of employment.

<p>
But even while these words are being written, there is one large fly
in the ointment. The store-window of E. &amp;. S. Meyers, 688
Broadway, New York, contains about <i> six hundred plumes and skins
of birds of paradise for sale for millinery purposes</i>. No wonder
the great bird of paradise is now almost extinct! Their sale here is
possible because the Dutcher law protects from the feather dealers
only the birds that belong to avian families represented in the
United States. With fiendish cunning and enterprise, the shameless
feather dealers are ferreting out the birds whose skins and plumes
may legally be imported into this country <a name="Page_117"
id="Page_117"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page117] </span> </a> and
sold; but we will meet that with a law that will protect all foreign
birds, so far as we are concerned. Now it is time for the universal
enactment of a law which will prohibit the sale and use as ornaments
of the plumage, feathers or skins of <i> any </i> wild bird that is
not a legitimate game bird.
</p>
<p>
London is now the head of the giant octopus of the "feather trade"
that has reached out its deadly tentacles into the most remote
wildernesses of the earth, and steadily is drawing in the "skins"
and "plumes" and "quills" of the most beautiful and most interesting
<i> unprotected </i> birds of the world. The extent of this
cold-blooded industry, supported by vain and hard-hearted women,
will presently be shown in detail. Paris is the great manufacturing
center of feather trimming and ornaments, and the French people
obstinately refuse to protect the birds from extermination, because
their slaughter affords employment to a certain numbers of French
factory operatives.
</p>
<p>
All over the world where they have real estate possessions, the men
of England know how to protect game from extermination. The English
are good at protecting game&mdash;when they decide to set about it.
</p>
<p>
Why should London be the Mecca of the feather-killers of the world?
</p>
<p>
It is easily explained:
</p>
<p>
(1) London has the greatest feather market in the world; (2) the
feather industry "wants the money"; and (3) the London feather
industry is willing to spend money in fighting to retain its
strangle-hold on the unprotected birds of the world.
</p>
<p>
Let us run through a small portion of the mass of fresh evidence
before us. It will be easier for the friends of birds to read these
details here than to procure them at first hand, as we have done.
</p>
<p>
The first thing that strikes one is the fact that the
feather-hunters are scattered <i> all over the world where bird life
is plentiful </i> and there are no laws to hinder their work. I
commend to every friend of birds this list of the species whose
plumage is to-day being bought and sold in large quantities every
year in London. To the birds of the world this list is of deadly
import, for it spells extermination.
</p>
<p>
The reader will notice that it is the way of the millinery octopus
to reach out to the uttermost ends of the earth, and take everything
that it can use. From the trackless jungles of New Guinea, round the
world both ways to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, no
unprotected bird is safe. The humming-birds of Brazil, the egrets of
the world at large, the rare birds of paradise, the toucan, the
eagle, the condor and the emu, all are being <i> exterminated </i>
to swell the annual profits of the millinery trade. The case is <i>
far </i> more serious than the world at large knows, or even
suspects. But for the profits, the birds would be safe; and no
unprotected wild species can long escape the hounds of Commerce.
</p>
<p>
But behold the list of rare, curious and beautiful birds that are
today in grave peril:

<p>
In order to throw a spot-light on the most recent transactions in
the London wild-birds'-plumage market, and to furnish a clear idea
of what is to-day going on in London, Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam, I
will set out in some detail the report of an agent whom I engaged to
ascertain the London dealings in the plumage of wild birds that were
killed especially to furnish that plumage. As one item, let us take
the sales in London in February, May and October, 1911, because they
bring the subject well down to date. My agent's explanatory note is
as follows:
</p>
<p>
"These three sales represent six months. Very nearly double this
quantity is sold by these four firms in a year. We must also take
into consideration that all the feathers are not brought to the
London market, and that <i> very large shipments are also made
direct to the raw-feather dealers and manufacturers of Paris and
Berlin, and that Amsterdam also gets large quantities from the West
Indies</i>. For your purpose, I report upon three sales, at
different periods of the year 1911, and as those sales do not vary
much, you will be able to judge the consumption of birds in a year."
</p>
<p>
The "aigrettes" of the feather trade come from egrets, and, being
very light, it requires the death of several birds to yield one
ounce. In many catalogues, the word "albatross" stands for the
jabiru, a nearly-exterminated species of giant stork, inhabiting
South America. "Rhea" often stands for vulture plumage.
</p>
<p>
If the feather dealers had deliberately attempted to form an
educational list of the most beautiful and the most interesting
birds of the world, they could hardly have done better than they
have done in the above list. If it were in my power to show the
reader a colored plate of each species now being exterminated by the
feather trade, he would be startled by the exhibit. That the very
choicest birds of the whole avian world should be thus blotted out
at the behest of vain and heartless women is a shame, a disgrace and
world-wide loss.

If I am correctly informed, the London feather trade admits that it
requires six egrets to yield one "ounce" of aigrette plumes. This
being the case, the 21,528 ounces sold as above stand for 129,168
egrets killed for nine months' supply of egret plumes, for London
alone.

The total number of bird corpses auctioned during these three sales

It is to be remembered that the sales listed above cover the
transactions of four firms only, and do not in any manner take into
account the direct importations from Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam of
manufacturers and other dealers. The defenders of the feather trade
are at great pains to assure the world that in the monthly,
bi-monthly and quarterly sales, feathers often appear in the market
twice in the same year; and this statement is made for them in order
to be absolutely fair. Recent examinations of the plume catalogues
for an entire year, marked with the price <i> paid </i> for each
item, reveals very few which are blank, indicating no sale! The
subtractions of the duplicated items would alter the result only
very slightly.
</p>
<p>
The full extent of England's annual consumption of the plumage of
wild birds slaughtered especially for the trade never has been
determined. I doubt whether it is possible to ascertain it. The
information that we have is so fragmentary that in all probability
it reflects only a small portion of the whole truth, but for all
that, it is sufficient to prove the case of the Defenders of the
Birds <i> vs</i>. the London Chamber of Commerce.

It is useless for anyone to assert that these birds were merely
"offered," and not actually sold, as Mr. Downham so laboriously
explains is the regular course with hummingbird skins; for that will
deceive no intelligent person. The statement published above comes
to me direct, from an absolutely competent and reliable source.

Undoubtedly the friends of birds, and likewise their enemies, will
be interested in the prices at which the skins of the most beautiful
birds of the world are sold in London, prior to their annihilation
by the feather industry. I submit the following exhibit, copied from
the circular of Messrs. Lewis &amp; Peat. It is at least of academic
interest.

<p>
Many thoughts are suggested by these London lists of bird slaughter
and loot.
</p>
<p>
It will be noticed that the breast of the grebe has almost wholly
disappeared from the feather market and from women's hats. The
reason is that there are no longer enough birds of that group to
hold a place in the London market! Few indeed are the Americans who
know that from 1900 to 1908 the lake region of southern Oregon was
the scene of the slaughter of uncountable thousands of those birds,
which continued until the grebes were almost exterminated.
</p>
<p>
When the wonderful lyre-bird of Australia had been almost
exterminated for its tail feathers, its open slaughter was stopped
by law, and a heavy fine was imposed on exportation, amounting, I
have been told, to $250 for each offense. My latest news of the
lyre-bird was of the surreptitious exportation of 200 skins to the
London feather market.
</p>
<p>
In India, the smuggling outward of the skins of protected birds is
constantly going on. Occasionally an exporter is caught and fined;
but that does not stop the traffic.
</p>
<p>
Bird-lovers must now bid farewell forever to all the birds of
paradise. Nothing but the legal closing of the world's markets
against their plumes and skins can save any of them. They never were
numerous; nor does any species range over a wide area. They are
strictly insular, and the island homes of some of them are very
small. Take the great bird of paradise (<i>Paradisea apoda</i>) as
an illustration. On Oct. 2, 1912, at Indianapolis, Indiana, a city
near the center of the United States, in three show-windows within
100 feet of the headquarters of the Fourth National Conservation
Congress, I counted 11 stuffed heads and 11 complete sets of plumes
of this bird, displayed for sale. The prices ranged from $30 to
$47.50 each! And while I looked, a large lady approached, pointed
her finger at the remains of a greater bird of paradise, and with
grim determination, said to her shopping companion: "There! I want
one o' them, an' I'm agoin' to <i> have </i> it, too!"
</p>
<p>
Says Mr. James Buckland in "Pros and Cons of the Plumage Bill":
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Goodfellow has returned within the last few weeks from a second
expedition to new Guinea.... One can now walk, he states, miles and
miles through the former haunts of these birds [of paradise] without
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page126]
</span> </a> seeing or hearing even the commonest species. When I
reflect on this sacrilege, I am lost in wonder at the apathy of the
British public."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Carl Hagenbeck wrote me only three months ago that "the condors
of the Andes are all being exterminated for their feathers, and
these birds are now very difficult to obtain."
</p>
<p>
The egret and heron plumes, known under the trade name of "osprey,
etc., feathers," form by far the most important item in each feather
sale. There are <i> fifteen </i> grades! They are sold by the ounce,
and the prices range all the way from twenty-eight cents per ounce
for "mixed heron" to <i> two hundred and twenty-five shillings </i>
($45.60) per ounce for the best Brazilian "short selected," on
February 7, 1912! Is it any wonder that in Philadelphia the prices
of finished aigrettes, ready to be worn, runs from $20 to $125!
</p>
<p>
The plumes that run up into the big figures are the "short selected"
coming from the following localities, and quoted at the prices set
down here in shillings and pence. Count the shilling at twenty-four
cents, United States money.

<p>
The total offering of these "short selected" plumes in December
1911, was 689 ounces, and in February, 1912, it was 230 ounces.
</p>
<p>
Now with these enormous prices prevailing, is it any wonder that the
egrets and herons are being relentlessly pursued to the uttermost
ends of the earth? I think that any man who really knows the habits
of egrets and herons, and the total impossibility of any quantity of
their shed feathers being picked up in a marketable state, must know
in his heart that if the London and continental feather markets keep
open a few years longer, <i> every species </i> that furnishes
"short selected" plumes will be utterly exterminated from off the
face of the earth.
</p>
<p>
Let the English people make no mistake about this, nor be fooled by
any fairy tales of the feather trade about Venezuelan "garceros,"
and vast quantities of valuable plumes picked off the bushes and out
of the mud. Those carefully concocted egret-farm stories make lovely
reading, but the reader who examines the evidence will soon decide
the extent of their truthfulness. I think that they contain not even
ten per cent of truth; and I shall not rest until the stories of
Leon Laglaize and Mayeul Grisol have been put to the test in the
regions where they originated.
</p>
<p>
A <i> few </i> plumes may be picked out of the jungle, yes; but as
for any <i> commercial quantity</i>, it is at present beyond belief.
Besides, we have direct, eye-witness testimony to the contrary.
</p>
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page127] </span> </a>
<p>
It must not be inferred that the friends of birds in England have
been idle or silent in the presence of the London feather trade. On
the contrary, the Royal Society for the Protection of Wild Birds and
Mr. James Buckland have so strongly attacked the feather industry
that the London Chamber of Commerce has felt called upon to come to
its rescue. Mr. Buckland, on his own individual account, has done
yeoman service to the cause, and his devotion to the birds, and his
tireless energy, are both almost beyond the reach of praise in
words. At the last moment before going to press I learn that the
birds'-plumage bill has achieved the triumph of a "first reading" in
Parliament, which looks as if success is at last in sight. The
powerful pamphlet that he has written, published and circulated at
his own expense, entitled "Pros and Cons of the Plumage Bill," is a
splendid effort. What a pity it is that more individuals are not
similarly inspired to make independent effort in the protection
cause! But, strange to say, few indeed are the men who have either
the nerve or the ability to "go it alone."
</p>
<p>
On the introduction in Parliament of the bill to save the birds from
the feather trade, it was opposed (through the efforts of the
Chamber of Commerce), on the ground that if any bill against the
sale of plumes should pass, and plumes could not be sold, the London
business in wild-bird skins and feathers "would immediately be
transferred to the continent!"
</p>
<p>
In the face of that devastating and altogether horrible prospect,
and because the London feather dealers "need the money," the bill
was at first defeated&mdash;to the great joy of the Chamber of
Commerce and Mr. Downham; but the cause of birds will win in the
end, because it is Right.
</p>
<p>
The feather dealers have been shrewdly active in the defense of
their trade, and the methods they have employed for influencing
public opinion have quite outshone those put forth by their brethren
in America. I have before me a copy of a booklet bearing the name of
Mr. C.F. Downham as the author, and the London Chamber of Commerce
has loaned its good name as publisher. Altogether it is a very
shrewd piece of work, even though its arguments in justification of
bird slaughter for the feather market are too absurd and weak for
serious consideration.
</p>
<p>
The chief burden of the defender of bird slaughter for millinery
purposes is on account of the destruction of egrets and herons, but
particularly the former. To offset as far as possible the absolutely
true charge that egrets bear their best plumes in their breeding
season, when the helpless young are in the nest and the parent birds
must be killed to obtain the plumes, the feather trade has obtained
from three Frenchmen&mdash;Leon Laglaize, Mayeul Grisol, and F.
Geay&mdash;a beautiful and plausible story to the effect that in
Venezuela the enormous output of egret plumes has been obtained <i>
by picking up, off the bushes and out of the water and mud, the shed
feathers of those birds! </i> According to the story, Venezuela is
full of <i> egret farms</i>, called "garceros,"&mdash;where the
birds breed and moult under strict supervision, and kindly drop
their feathers in such places that it is possible <i> to find
them</i>, and to <i> pick <a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page128] </span> </a> them up</i>, in a high
state of preservation! And we are asked to believe that it is these
very Venezuelan picked-up feathers that command in London the high
price of <i> $44 per ounce</i>.

Mr. Laglaize is especially exploited by Mr. Downham, as a French
traveler of high standing, and well known in the zoological museums
of France; but, sad to say, when Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn cabled
to the Museum of Natural History in Paris, inquiring about Mr.
Laglaize, the cable flashed back the one sad word; "<i>Inconnu!</i>"
(Unknown!)
</p>
<p>
I think it entirely possible that enough shed feathers have been
picked up in the reeking swamps of Venezuela, on the upper
tributaries of the Orinoco, to afford <i> an excuse </i> for the
beautiful story of Mr. Laglaize. Any shrewd individual with money,
and the influence that money secures, could put up just such a
"plant" as I firmly believe <i> has </i> been put up by some one in
Venezuela. I will guarantee that I could accomplish such a job in
Venezuela or Brazil, in four months' time, at an expense not
exceeding one thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>
That the great supply of immaculately perfect egret plumes that
annually come out of Venezuela could by any possibility be picked up
in the <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page129] </span> </a> swamps where they were shed and dropped by
the egrets, is entirely preposterous and incredible. The whole
proportion is denounced by several men of standing and experience,
none of whom are "<i>inconnu</i>."
</p>
<p>
As a sweeping refutation of the fantastic statements regarding
"garceros," published by Mr. Downham as coming from Messrs.
Laglaize, Grisol and Geay, I offer the written testimony of an
American gentleman who at this moment owns and maintains within a
few yards of his residence a large preserve of snowy egrets and
herons, the former representing the species which furnishes egret
plumes exactly similar to those shipped from Venezuela and Brazil.
If the testimony of Mr. McIlhenny is not sufficient to stamp the
statements of the three Frenchmen quoted by Mr. Downham as absolute
and thoroughly misleading falsehoods, then there is no such thing in
this world as evidence. I suggest a perusal of the statements of the
three Frenchmen who are quoted with such confidence by Mr. Downham
and published by the Hon. Chamber of Commerce at London, and then a
careful reading of the following letter:
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<blockquote>
	<div align="right">
		Avery Island, La., June 17, 1912.
	</div>
	<p style="font-variant: small-caps">
		Dear Mr. Hornaday:&mdash;
	</p>
	<p>
I have before me your letter of June 8th, asking for information as
to whether or no egrets shed their plumes at their nesting places in
sufficient quantities to enable them to be gathered commercially. I
most emphatically wish to state that it is impossible to gather at
the nesting places of these birds any quantity of their plumes. I
have nesting within 50 yards of where I am now sitting dictating
this letter not less than 20,000 pairs of the various species of
herons and egrets, and there are fully 2,500 pairs of snowy herons
nesting within my preserve.
	</p>
	<p>
During the nesting season, which covers the months of April, May and
June, I am through this heronry in a small canoe almost every day,
and often twice a day. I have had these herons under my close
inspection for the past 17 years, and I have not in any one season
picked up or seen more than half a dozen discarded plumes. Such
plumes as I have picked up, I have kept on my desk, and given to the
people who were interested. I remember that last year I picked up
four plumes of the snowy heron that were in one bunch. I think these
must have been plucked out by the birds fighting.
	</p>
	<p>
This year I have found only one plume so far. I enclose it herewith.
You will notice that it is one of the shorter plumes, and is badly
worn at the end, as have been all the plumes which I have picked up
in my heronry.
	</p>
	<p>
I am positive that it is not possible for natural shed plumes to be
gathered commercially. I have a number of times talked with plume
hunters from Venezuela and other South American countries, and I
have never heard of any egret feathers being gathered by their being
picked up after the birds have shed them.
	</p>
	<p>
I have heard of a number of heronries in South America that are
protected by the land owners for the purpose of gathering a yearly
crop of egret plumes, but this crop is gathered always by shooting a
certain percentage of the birds. This shooting is done by experts
with 22-calibre rifles, and does not materially disturb the nesting
colony. I have known of two men who have been engaged in killing the
birds on large estates in South America, who were paid regular
salaries for their services as egret hunters.
	</p>
	<p>
Very truly yours,
	</p>
	<p style="font-variant:
small-caps">
		E.A. McIlhenny.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p>
I am more than willing to set the above against the fairy tale of
Mr. Laglaize.
</p>
<p>
Here is the testimony of A.H. Meyer, an ex-plume-hunter, who for
nine <a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page130] </span> </a> years worked in Venezuela. His sworn
testimony was laid before the Legislature of the State of New York,
in 1911, when the New York Milliners' Association was frantically
endeavoring to secure the repeal of the splendid Dutcher law. This
witness was produced by the National Association of Audubon
Societies.
</p>
<p>
"My attention has been called to the fact that certain commercial
interests in this city are circulating stories in the newspapers and
elsewhere to the effect that the aigrettes used in the millinery
trade come chiefly from Venezuela, where they are gathered from the
ground in the large <i> garceros</i>, or breeding-colonies, of white
herons.
</p>
<p>
"I wish to state that I have personally engaged in the work of
collecting the plumes of these birds in Venezuela. This was my
business for the years 1896 to 1905, inclusive. I am thoroughly
conversant with the methods employed in gathering egret and snowy
heron plumes in Venezuela, and I wish to give the following
statement regarding the practices employed in procuring these
feathers:
</p>
<p>
"The birds gather in large colonies to rear their young. They have
the plumes only during the mating and nesting season. After the
period when they are employed in caring for their young, it is found
that the plumes are virtually of no commercial value, because of the
worn and frayed condition to which they have been reduced. It is the
custom in Venezuela to shoot the birds while the young are in the
nests. A few feathers of the large white heron (American egret),
known as the <i> Garza blanca</i>, can be picked up of a morning
about their breeding places, but these are of small value and are
known as "dead feathers." They are worth locally not over three
dollars an ounce; while the feathers taken from the bird, known as
"live feathers," are worth fifteen dollars an ounce.
</p>
<p>
"My work led me into every part of Venezuela and Colombia where
these birds are to be found, and I have never yet found or heard of
any <i> garceros </i> that were guarded for the purpose of simply
gathering the feathers from the ground. No such condition exists in
Venezuela. The story is absolutely without foundation, in my
opinion, and has simply been put forward for commercial purposes.
</p>
<p>
"The natives of the country, who do virtually all of the hunting for
feathers, are not provident in their nature, and their practices are
of a most cruel and brutal nature. I have seen them frequently pull
the plumes from wounded birds, leaving the crippled birds to die of
starvation, unable to respond to the cries of their young in the
nests above, which were calling for food. <i> I have known these
people to tie and prop up wounded egrets on the marsh where they
would attract the attention of other birds flying by. These decoys
they keep in this position until they die of their wounds, or from
the attacks of insects. I have seen the terrible red ants of that
country actually eating out the eyes of these wounded, helpless
birds that were tied up by the plume-hunters. </i> I could write you
many pages of the horrors practiced in gathering aigrette feathers
in Venezuela by the natives for the millinery trade of Paris and New
York.

<p>
"To illustrate the comparatively small number of dead feathers which
are collected, I will mention that in one year I and my associates
shipped to New York eighty pounds of the plumes of the large heron
and twelve pounds of the little recurved plumes of the snowy heron.
In this whole lot there were not over five pounds of plumes that had
been gathered from the ground&mdash;and these were of little value.
The plume-birds have been nearly exterminated in the United States
and Mexico, and the same condition of affairs will soon exist in
tropical America. This extermination will come about because of the
fact that the young are left to starve in the nest when the old
birds are killed, any other statement made by interested parties to
the contrary notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>
"I am so incensed at the ridiculously absurd and misleading stories
that are being published on this question that I want to give you
this letter, and, before delivering it to you, shall take oath to
its truthfulness."
</p>
<p>
Here is the testimony of Mr. Caspar Whitney, of New York, formerly
editor of <i> Outing </i> Magazine and <i> Outdoor America</i>:
</p>
<p>
"During extended travel throughout South America, from 1903 to 1907,
inclusive, I journeyed, on three separate occasions, by canoe
(1904-1907), on the Lower Orinoco and Apure rivers and their
tributaries. This is the region, so far as Venezuela is concerned,
in which is the greatest slaughter of white herons for their
plumage, or more specifically for the marital plumes, which are
carried only in the mating and breeding season, and are known in the
millinery trade as 'aigrettes.'
</p>
<p>
"There is literally no room for question. The snowy herons are
killed exactly as I describe. It is the custom of all those who hunt
for the millinery trade, and is recognized by the natives as the
usual method."
</p>
<p>
Here is the testimony of Mr. Julian A. Dimock, of Peekamose, N.Y.,
the famous outdoor photographer, and illustrator of "Florida
Enchantments":
</p>
<p>
"I know a goodly number of the plume-hunters of Florida. I have
camped with them, and talked to them. I have heard their tales, and
even full accounts of the 'shooting-up' of an egret rookery. Never
has a man in Florida suggested to me that plumes could be obtained
without killing the birds. I have known the wardens, and have
visited rookeries after they had been 'shot-up,' and the evidence
all pointed to the everlasting use of the gun. <i> It is certainly
not true that the plumes can be obtained without killing the birds
bearing them</i>.
</p>
<p>
"Nineteen years ago, I visited the Cuthbert Rookery with one of the
men who discovered the birds nesting in that lake. He and his
partner had sold the plumes gathered there for more than a thousand
dollars. He showed me how they hid in the bushes and shot the birds.
He even gave me a chance to watch him kill two or three birds.
</p>
<p>
"I know personally the man chiefly responsible for the slaughter of
the birds at Alligator Bay. <i> He laughed at the idea of getting
plumes without killing the birds! </i> I well know the man who shot
the birds up Rogers River, and even saw some of the empty shells
left on the ground by him.

<p>
I have camped with Seminoles, whites, blacks, outlaws, and those
within the pale, connected with plume-hunting, and all tell the same
story: <i> The birds are shot to get the plumes. </i> The evidence
of my own eyes, and the action of the birds themselves, convinces me
that there is not a shadow of doubt concerning this point."
</p>
<p>
This sworn testimony from Mr. T.J. Ashe, of Key West, Florida, is
very direct and to the point:
</p>
<p>
"I have seen many moulted and dropped feathers from wild plumed
birds. I have never seen a moulted or dropped feather that was fit
for anything. It is the exception when a plumed bird drops feathers
of any value while in flight. Whatever feathers are so dropped are
those that are frayed, worn out, and forced out by the process of
moulting. The moulting season is not during the hatching season, but
is after the hatching season. The shedding, or moulting, takes place
once a year; and during this moulting season the feathers, after
having the hard usage of the year from wind, rain and other causes,
when dropped are of absolutely no commercial value."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Arthur T. Wayne, of Mount Pleasant, S.C., relates in sworn
testimony his experience in attempting to secure egret plumes
without killing the birds:
</p>
<p>
"It is utterly impossible to get fifty egret plumes from any colony
of breeding birds without shooting the birds. Last spring, I went
twice a week to a breeding colony of American and snowy egrets, from
early in April until June 8. Despite the fact that I covered miles
of territory in a boat, I picked up but two American egret plumes
(which I now have); but not a single snowy egret plume did I see,
nor did my companion, who accompanied me on every trip.
</p>
<p>
"I saw an American egret plume on the water, and left it, purposely,
to see whether it would sink or not. Upon visiting the place a few
days afterwards, the plume was not in evidence, undoubtedly having
sunk. The plumes are chiefly shed in the air while the birds are
going to or coming from their breeding grounds. If that millinery
plume law is repealed, the fate of the American and snowy egrets is
sealed, for the few birds that remain will be shot to the very last
one."
</p>
<p>
Any man who ever has been in an egret rookery (and I have) knows
that the above testimony is <i> true</i>! The French story of the
beautiful and smoothly-running egret farms in Venezuela is
preposterous, save for a mere shadow of truth. I do not say that <i>
no </i> egret plumes could be picked up, but I do assert that the
total quantity obtainable in one year in that way would be utterly
trivial.
</p>
<p>
No; the "ospreys" of the British feather market come from
slaughtered egrets and herons, <i> killed in the breeding
season</i>. Let the British public and the British Parliament make
no mistake about that. If they wish the trade to continue, let it be
based on the impregnable ground that the merchants want the money,
and not on a fantastic dream that is too silly to deceive even a
child that knows birds.
</p>
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page134] </span> </a>
<p>
The use or disuse of wild birds' plumage as millinery ornaments is
another of those wild-life subjects regarding which there is no room
for argument. To assert that the feather-dealers want the business
for the money it brings them is not argument! We have seen many a
steam roller go over Truth, and Right, and Justice, by main strength
and red-hot power; but Truth and Right refuse to stay flat down.
There is on this earth not one wild-animal species&mdash;mammal,
bird or reptile&mdash;that can long withstand exploitation for
commercial purposes. Even the whales of the deep sea, the walrus of
the arctic regions, the condors of the Andes and alligators of the
Everglade morasses are no exception to the universal rule.
</p>
<p>
In Mr. Downham's book there is much fallacious reasoning, and many
conclusions that are not borne out by the facts. For example, he
says that no species of bird of paradise has been diminished in
number by slaughter for the feather trade; that Florida still
contains a supply of egrets; that the decrease in bird life should
be charged to the spread of cities, towns and farms, and not to the
trade; that the trade was "in no way responsible" for the slaughter
of three hundred thousand gulls and albatrosses on Laysan Island!
</p>
<p>
I have space to notice one other important erroneous conclusion that
Mr. Downham publishes in his book, on page 105. He says:
</p>
<p>
"The destruction of birds in foreign countries is something that no
trade can direct or control."
</p>
<p>
This is an amazing declaration; and absolutely contrary to
experience. Let me prove what I say by a fresh and incontestable
illustration:
</p>
<p>
Prior to April, 1911, when Governor Dix signed the Bayne law against
the sale of wild native game in the State of New York, Currituck
County, N.C., was a vast slaughter-pen for wild fowl. No power or
persuasion had availed to induce the people of North Carolina to
check, or regulate, or in any manner mitigate that slaughter of
geese, ducks and swans. It was estimated that two hundred thousand
wild fowl were annually slaughtered there.
</p>
<p>
We who advocated the Bayne law said: "Close the New York markets
against Currituck birds, and you will stop a great deal of the
slaughter."
</p>
<p>
We cleaned our Augean stable. The greatest game market in America
was absolutely closed.
</p>
<p>
Last winter (1911) the annual killing of wild fowl was fully fifty
per cent less than during previous years. In one small town, twenty
professional duck shooters went entirely out of
business&mdash;because they <i> couldn't sell their ducks</i>! The
dealers refused to buy them. The result was exactly what we
predicted it would be; and this year, it is reported over and over
that ducks are more plentiful in New England than they have been in
twenty years previously! The result is wonderful, because so quick.
</p>
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page135] </span> </a>
<p>
Beyond all question, the feather merchants of London, Paris and
Berlin absolutely control the bird-killers of Venezuela, China, New
Guinea. Mexico and South America. Let the word go forth that "the
trade" is no longer permitted to buy and sell egret and heron
plumes, skins of birds of paradise and condor feathers, and presto!
the killing industry falls dead the next moment.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Yes, indeed, members of the British Parliament: it is easily within
<i> your power </i> to wipe out at a single stroke fully one-half of
the bird slaughter for fancy feathers. It can be done just as we
wiped out one-half the annual duck slaughter in wickedly-wasteful
North Carolina!
</p>
<p>
The feather trade absolutely <i> does </i> control the killing
situation! Now, will the people of England clean house by
controlling the feather trade? If a hundred species of the most
beautiful birds of the world must be exterminated for the feather
trade, let the odium rest elsewhere than on the people of England.
</p>
<p>
The bird-lovers of America may rest assured that the bird-lovers of
England&mdash;a mighty host&mdash;are neither careless nor
indifferent regarding the wild-birds' plumage business. On the
contrary, several bills have been brought before Parliament intended
to regulate or prohibit the traffic, and a measure of vast
importance to the birds of the world is now before the House of
Commons. It is backed by Mr. Percy Alden, M.P., by the Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds, by the Selbourne Society, and by Mr.
James Buckland&mdash;a host in himself. For years past that
splendidly-equipped and well-managed Royal Society has waged <a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page136]
</span> </a> ceaseless warfare for the birds. Its activity has been
tremendous, and its membership list contains many of the finest
names in England. The address of the Honorary Secretary, Frank E.
Lemon, Esq., is 23 Queen Anne's Gate, London, S.W.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, these influences are opposed by the Textile Trade Section
of the London Chamber of Commerce, and their only argument consists
of the plea that if London doesn't get the money out of the feather
trade, the Continent will get it! A reasonable, logical, magnificent
and convincing excuse for wholesale bird slaughter, truly!
</p>
<p>
Mr. Buckland has been informed from the Continent that the people of
France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are waiting and
watching to see what England is going to do with the question, "To
slaughter, or not to slaughter?" For England has no monopoly of the
birds' plumage trade, not by any means. Says Mr. Buckland ("Pros and
Cons of the Plumage Bill," page 17):
</p>
<p>
"As regards the vast majority of fancy feathers used in millinery,
the Continent receives its own supplies. The feathers of the
hundreds of thousands of albatrosses which are killed in the North
Pacific all go to Paris. Of the untold thousands of 'magpies,' owls,
and other species which come from Peru, not one skin or feather
crosses the Channel. The white herons of the Upper Senegal and the
Niger are being rapidly exterminated at the instigation of the
feather merchants, but not one of the plumes reaches London. Paris
receives direct a large supply of aigrettes from South America and
elsewhere. &hellip; The millions of swallows and other migratory
birds which are killed annually as they pass through Italy, France
and Spain on their way north, supply the millinery trade of Europe
with an incredible quantity of wings and other plumage, but none of
it is distributed from London. &hellip; London, as a distributing
center, has no monopoly of the trade in raw feathers."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Buckland's green-covered pamphlet is a powerful document, and
both his facts and his conclusions seem to be unassailable. The
author's address is Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Ave.,
London, W.C.
</p>
<p>
The duty of the civilized nations of Europe is perfectly plain. The
savage and bloody business in feathers torn from wild birds should
be stopped, completely and forever. If the commons will not arise
and reform the odious business out of existence, then the kings and
queens and presidents should do their plain duty. In the suppression
of a world crime like this it is clearly a case of <i> noblesse
oblige</i>!

		CHAPTER XIV
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		THE BIRD TRAGEDY ON LAYSAN ISLAND
	</div>
</div>
<p>
This chapter is a curtain-dropper to the preceding chapter. As a
clearly-cut, concrete case, the reader will find it unique and
unsurpassed. It should be of lively interest to every American
because the tragedy occurred on American territory.
</p>
<p>
In the far-away North Pacific Ocean, about seven hundred miles from
Honolulu west-b'-north, lies the small island of Laysan. It is
level, sandy, poorly planted by nature, and barren of all things
likely to enlist the attention of predatory man. To the harassed
birds of mid-ocean, it seemed like a secure haven, and for ages past
it has been inhabited only by them. There several species of sea
birds, large and small, have found homes and breeding places. Until
1909, the inhabitants consisted of the Laysan albatross,
black-footed albatross, sooty tern, gray-backed tern, noddy tern,
Hawaiian tern, white tern, Bonin petrel, two shearwaters, the
red-tailed tropic bird, two boobies and the man-of-war bird.
</p>
<p>
Laysan Island is two miles long by one and one-half miles broad, and
at times it has been literally covered with birds. Its bird life was
first brought prominently to notice in 1891, by Henry Palmer, the
agent of Hon. Walter Rothschild, and in 1902 and 1903 Walter K.
Fisher and W.A. Bryan made further observations.
</p>
<p>
Ever since 1891 the bird life on Laysan has been regarded as one of
the wonders of the bird world. One of the photographs taken prior to
1909 shows a vast plain, apparently a square mile in area, covered
and crowded with Laysan albatrosses. They stand there on the level
sand, serene, bulky and immaculate. Thousands of birds appear in one
view&mdash;a very remarkable sight.
</p>
<p>
Naturally man, the ever-greedy, began to cast about for ways by
which to convert some product of that feathered host into money. At
first guano and eggs were collected. A tramway was laid down and
small box-cars were introduced, in which the collected material was
piled and pushed down to the packing place.
</p>
<p>
For several years this went on, and the birds themselves were not
molested. At last, however, a tentacle of the feather-trade octopus
reached out to Laysan. In an evil moment in the spring of 1909, a
predatory individual of Honolulu and elsewhere, named Max Schlemmer,
decided that the wings of those albatross, gulls and terns should be
torn off and sent to Japan, whence they would undoubtedly be shipped
to Paris, the special market for the wings of sea-birds slaughtered
in the North Pacific.

</p>
<p>
Schlemmer the Slaughterer bought a cheap vessel, hired twenty-three
phlegmatic and cold-blooded Japanese laborers, and organized a raid
on Laysan. With the utmost secrecy he sailed from Honolulu, landed
his bird-killers upon the sea-bird wonderland, and turned them loose
upon the birds.
</p>
<p>
For several months they slaughtered diligently and without mercy.
Apparently it was the ambition of Schlemmer to kill every bird on
the island.
</p>
<p>
By the time the bird-butchers had accumulated between three and four
car-loads of wings, and the carnage was half finished, William A.
Bryan, Professor of Zoology in the College of Honolulu, heard of it
and promptly wired the United States Government.
</p>
<p>
Without the loss of a moment the Secretary of the Navy despatched
the revenue cutter <i> Thetis </i> to the shambles of Laysan. When
Captain Jacobs arrived he found that in round numbers about <i>
three hundred thousand </i> birds had been destroyed, and all that
remained of them were several acres of bones and dead bodies, and
about three carloads of wings, feathers and skins. It was evident
that Schlemmer's intention was to kill all the birds on the island,
and only the timely arrival of the <i> Thetis </i> frustrated that
bloody plan.
</p>
<p>
The twenty-three Japanese poachers were arrested and taken to
Honolulu for trial, and the <i> Thetis </i> also brought away all
the stolen wings and plumage with the exception of one shedful of
wings that had to be left <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page140] </span> </a> behind on account of lack
of carrying space. That old shed, with one end torn out, and
supposed to contain nearly fifty thousand pairs of wings, was
photographed by Prof. Dill in 1911, as shown herewith.

</p>
<p>
Three hundred thousand albatrosses, gulls, terns and other birds
were butchered to make a Schlemmer holiday! Had the arrival of the
<i> Thetis </i> been delayed, it is reasonably certain that every
bird on Laysan would have been killed to satisfy the wolfish
rapacity of one money-grubbing white man.
</p>
<p>
In 1911, the Iowa State University despatched to Laysan a scientific
expedition in charge of Prof. Homer R. Dill. The party landed on the
island on April 24 and remained until June 5, and the report of
Professor Dill (U.S. Department of Agriculture) is consumedly
interesting to the friends of birds. Here is what he has said
regarding the evidences of bird-slaughter:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
"Our first impression of Laysan was that the poachers had stripped
the place of bird life. An area of over 300 acres on each side of
the buildings was apparently abandoned. Only the shearwaters moaning
in their burrows, the little wingless rail skulking from one grass
tussock to another, and the saucy finch remained. It is an excellent
example of what Prof. Nutting calls the survival of the
inconspicuous.
	</p>
	<p>
"Here on every side are bones bleaching in the sun, showing where
the poachers had piled the bodies of the birds as they stripped them
of wings and feathers. In the old open guano shed were seen the
remains of hundreds and possibly thousands of wings which were
placed there but never cured for shipping, as the marauders were
interrupted in their work.
	</p>

</center>
<p class="captionheading">
	SHED FILLED WITH WINGS OF SLAUGHTERED BIRDS ON LAYSAN ISLAND
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
"An old cistern back of one of the buildings tells a story of
cruelty that surpasses anything else done by these heartless,
sanguinary pirates, not excepting the practice of cutting wings from
living birds and leaving them to die of hemorrhage. In this dry
cistern the living birds were kept by hundreds to slowly starve to
death. In this way the fatty tissue lying next to the skin was used
up, and the skin was left quite free from grease, so that it
required little or no cleaning during preparation.
	</p>
	<p>
"Many other revolting sights, such as the remains of young birds
that had been left to starve, and birds with broken legs and
deformed beaks were to be seen. Killing clubs, nets and other
implements used by these marauders were lying all about. Hundreds of
boxes to be used in shipping the bird skins were packed in an old
building. It was very evident they intended to carry on their
slaughter as long as the birds lasted.
	</p>
	<p>
"Not only did they kill and skin the larger species but they caught
and caged the finch, honey eater, and miller bird. Cages and
material for making them were found."&mdash;(Report of an Expedition
to Laysan Island in 1911. By Homer R. Dill, page 12.)
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The report of Professor Bryan contains the following pertinent
paragraphs:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
"This wholesale killing has had an appalling effect on the
colony.... It is conservative to say that fully one-half the number
of birds of both <a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page142] </span> </a> species of albatross that
were so abundant everywhere in 1903 have been killed. The colonies
that remain are in a sadly decimated condition. &hellip; Over a
large part of the island, in some sections a hundred acres in a
place, that ten years ago were thickly inhabited by albatrosses not
a single bird remains, while heaps of the slain lie as mute
testimony of the awful slaughter of these beautiful, harmless, and
without doubt beneficial inhabitants of the high seas.
	</p>
	<p>
"While the main activity of the plume-hunters was directed against
the albatrosses, they were by no means averse to killing anything in
the bird line that came in their way. &hellip; Fortunately, serious
as were the depredations of the poachers, their operations were
interrupted before any of the species had been completely
exterminated."
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the work of the Evil Genius of Laysan did not stop with the
slaughter of three hundred thousand birds. Mr. Schlemmer introduced
rabbits and guinea-pigs; and these rapidly multiplying rodents now
are threatening to consume every plant on the island. If the plants
disappear, many of the insects will go with them; and this will mean
the disappearance of the small insectivorous birds.
</p>
<p>
In February, 1909, President Roosevelt issued an executive order
creating the Hawaiian Islands Reservation for Birds. In this are
included Laysan and twelve other islands and reefs, some of which
are inhabited by birds that are well worth preserving. By this act,
we may feel that for the future the birds of Laysan and neighboring
islets are secure from further attacks by the bloody-handed agents
of the vain women who still insist upon wearing the wings and
feathers of wild birds.

		UNFAIR FIREARMS, AND SHOOTING ETHICS
	</div>
</div>
<p>
For considerably more than a century, the States of the American
Union have enacted game-protective laws based on the principle that
the wild game belongs to the People, and the people's senators,
representatives and legislators generally may therefore enact laws
for its protection, prescribing the manner in which it may and may
not be taken and possessed. The soundness of this principle has been
fully confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the
case of Geer vs. Connecticut, on March 2, 1896.
</p>
<p>
The tendency of predatory man to kill and capture wild game of all
kinds by wholesale methods is as old as the human race. The days of
the club, the stone axe, the bow and arrow and the flint-lock gun
were contemporaneous with the days of great abundance of game. Now
that the advent of breech-loaders, repeaters, automatics and fixed
ammunition has rendered game scarce in all localities save a very
few, the thoughtful man is driven to consider measures for the
checking of destruction and the suppression of wholesale slaughter.
</p>
<p>
First of all, the deadly floating batteries and sail-boats were
prohibited. To-day a punt gun is justly regarded as a relic of
barbarism, and any man who uses one places himself beyond the pale
of decent sportsmanship, or even of modern pot-hunting. Strange to
say, although the unwritten code of ethics of English sportsmen is
very strict, the English to this day permit wild-fowl hunting with
guns of huge calibre, some of which are more like shot-cannons than
shot-guns. And they say, "Well, there are still wild duck on our
coast!"
</p>
<p>
Beyond question, it is now high time for the English people to take
up the shot-gun question, and consider what to-day is fair and
unfair in the killing of waterfowl. The supply of British ducks and
geese can not forever withstand the market gunners and their
shot-cannons. Has not the British wild-fowl supply greatly decreased
during the past fifteen years? I strongly suspect that a careful
investigation would reveal the fact that it has diminished. The
Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire should look
into the matter, and obtain a series of reports on the condition of
the waterfowl to-day as compared with what it was twenty years ago.
</p>
<p>
In the United States we have eliminated the swivel guns, the punt
guns and the very-big-bore guns. Among the real sportsmen the
tendency is steadily toward shot-guns of small calibre, especially
under 12-gauge. But, outside the ranks of sportsmen, we are now face
to face with two <a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page144] </span> </a> automatic and five "pump"
shotguns of deadly efficiency. Of these, more than one hundred
thousand are being made and sold annually by the five companies that
produce them. Recently the annual output has been carefully
estimated from known facts to be about as follows:

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Ethics Of Shooting And Shot-Guns. </span> &mdash;Are the American people willing that their wild birds shall be shot by machinery?
</p>
<p>
In the ethics of sportsmanship, the anglers of America are miles
ahead of the men who handle the rifle and shot-gun in the hunting
field. Will the hunters ever catch up?
</p>
<p>
The anglers have steadily diminished the weight of the rod and the
size of the line; and they have prohibited the use of gang hooks and
nets. In this respect the initiative of the Tuna Club of Santa
Catalina is worthy of the highest admiration. Even though the
leaping tuna, the jewfish and the sword-fish are big and powerful,
the club has elected to raise the standard of sportsmanship by
making captures more difficult than ever before. A higher degree of
skill, and nerve and judgment, is required in the angler who would
make good on a big fish; and, incidentally, the fish has about
double "the show" that it had fifteen years ago.
</p>
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page145] </span> </a>
<p>
That is Sportsmanship!
</p>
<p>
But how is it with the men who handle the shot-gun?
</p>
<p>
By them, the Tuna Club's high-class principle has been exactly
reversed! In the making of fishing-rods, commercialism plays small
part; but in about forty cases out of every fifty the making of guns
is solely a matter of dollars and profits.
</p>
<p>
Excepting the condemnation of automatic and pump guns, I think that
few clubs of sportsmen have laid down laws designed to make shooting
more difficult, and to give the game more of a show to escape.
Thousands of gentlemen sportsmen have their own separate unwritten
codes of honor, but so far as I know, few of them have been written
out and adopted as binding rules of action. I know that among expert
wing shots it is an unwritten law that quail and grouse must not be
shot on the ground, nor ducks on the water. But, among the three
million gunners who annually shoot in the United States how many,
think you, are there who in actual practice observe any sentimental
principles when in the presence of killable game? I should say about
one man and boy out of every five hundred.
</p>
<p>
Up to this time, the great mass of men who handle guns have left it
to the gunmakers to make their codes of ethics, and hand them out
with the loaded cartridges, all ready for use.
</p>
<p>
For fifty years the makers of shot-guns and rifles have taxed their
ingenuity and resources to make killing easier, especially for
"amateur" sportsmen,&mdash;<i>and take still greater advantages of
the game</i>! Look at this scale of progression:

<p>
There are 66 factories producing firearms and ammunition, employing
$39,377,000 of invested capital and 15,000 employees.
</p>
<p>
The sole and dominant thought of many gunmakers is to make the very
deadliest guns that human skill can invent, sell them as fast as <a
name="Page_146" id="Page_146"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page146]
</span> </a> possible, and declare dividends on their stock. The
Remington, Winchester, Marlin, Stevens and Union Companies are
engaged in a mad race to see who can turn out the deadliest guns,
and the most of them. On the market to-day there are five pump-guns,
that fire six shots each, in about <i> six seconds</i>, without
removal from the shoulder, by the quick sliding of a sleeve under
the barrel, that ejects the empty shell and inserts a loaded one.
There are two automatics that fire five shots each in <i> five
seconds or less</i>, by five pulls on the trigger! <i> The
autoloading gun is reloaded and cocked again wholly by its own
recoil</i>. Now, if these are not machine guns, what are they?
</p>
<p>
In view of the great scarcity of feathered game, and the number of
deadly machine guns already on the market, the production of the
last and deadliest automatic gun (by the Winchester Arms Company),
<i> already in great demand</i>, is a crime against wild life, no
less.
</p>
<p>
Every human action is a matter of taste and individual honor.
</p>
<p>
It is natural for the duck-butchers of Currituck to love the
automatic shot-guns as they do, because they kill the most ducks per
flock. With two of them in his boat, holding <i> ten shots</i>, one
expert duck-killer can,&mdash;and sometimes <i> actually does</i>,
so it is said,&mdash;get every duck out of a flock, up to seven or
eight.
</p>
<p>
It is natural for an awkward and blundering wing-shot to love the
deadliest gun, in order that he may make as good a bag as an expert
shot can make with a double-barreled gun. It is natural for the
hunter who does not care a rap about the extermination of species to
love the gun that will enable him to kill up to the bag limit, every
time he takes the field. It is natural for men who don't think, or
who think in circles, to say "so long as I observe the lawful bag
limit, what difference does it make what kind of a gun I use?"
</p>
<p>
It is natural for the Remington, and Winchester, and Marlin
gun-makers to say, as they do, "Enforce the laws! Shorten the open
seasons! Reduce the bag limit, and then it won't matter what guns
are used! But,&mdash;DON'T touch autoloading guns! Don't hamper
Inventive Genius!"
</p>
<p>
Is it not high time for American sportsmen to cease taking their
moral principles and their codes of ethics from the gun-makers?
</p>
<p>
Here is a question that I would like to put before every hunter of
game in America:
</p>
<p>
In view of the alarming scarcity of game, in view of the impending
extermination of species by legal hunting, can any high-minded <i>
sportsman</i>, can any <i> good citizen </i> either sell a machine
shot-gun or use one in hunting?
</p>
<p>
A gentleman is incapable of taking an unfair advantage of any wild
creature; therefore a gentleman cannot use punt guns for ducks,
dynamite for game fish, or automatic or pump guns in bird-shooting.
The machine guns and "silencers" are grossly unfair, and like
gang-hooks, nets and <a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page147] </span> </a> dynamite for trout and
bass, their use in hunting must everywhere be prohibited by law.
Times have changed, and the lines for protection must be more
tightly drawn.

	THE CHAMPION GAME SLAUGHTER CASE
</p>
<p class="captionsubheading">
	One Hour's Slaughter (218 Geese) With Two Automatic Shot-Guns
</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (Judge Orlady) has decided that
the Pennsylvania law against the use of automatic guns in hunting is
entirely constitutional, because every state has a right to say how
its game may and may not be killed.
</p>
<p>
It is up to the American People to say <i> now </i> whether their
wild life shall be slaughtered by machinery, or not.
</p>
<p>
If they are willing that it should be, then let us be consistent and
say&mdash;away with all "conservation!" The game conservators can
endure a gameless and birdless continent quite as well as the
average citizen can.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> How They Work. </span> &mdash;There are a few apologists for the automatic and pump guns who cheerfully say, "So long as the bag limit is observed what difference does it make how the birds are killed?"
</p>
<p>
It is strange that a conscientious man should ask such a question,
when the answer is apparent.
</p>
<p>
We reply, "The difference is that an automatic or pump gun will kill
fully twice as many waterfowl as a double-barrel, <i> if not
more</i>; and <i> it is highly undesirable that every gunner should
get the bag limit of <a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page148] </span> </a> birds, or any number near
it</i>! The birds can not stand it. Moreover, <i> the best states
for ducks and geese have no bag limits on those birds</i>! To-day,
on Currituck Sound, for example, the market hunters are killing all
the waterfowl they can sell. On Marsh Island, Louisiana, one man has
killed 369 ducks in one day, and another market gunner killed 430 in
one day.
</p>
<p>
The automatic and the "pump" shot-guns are the favorite weapons of
the game-hog who makes a specialty of geese and ducks. It is no
uncommon thing for a gunner who shoots a machine gun to get, with
one gun, as high as <i> eight </i> birds out of one flock. A man who
has himself done this has told me so.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="latin"> <i> The Champion Game-Slaughter Case. </i> </span> &mdash;Here is a story from California that is no fairy tale. It was published, most innocently, in a western magazine, with the illustration that appears herewith, and in which please notice the automatic shot-gun:
</p>
<p>
"February 5th, I and a friend were at one of the Glenn County Club's
camps. &hellip; Neither of us having ever had the pleasure of
shooting over live decoys, we were anxious, and could hardly wait
for the sport to commence. On arriving at the scene we noticed holes
which had been dug in the ground, just large enough for a man to
crawl into. These holes were used for hiding places, and were deep
enough so the sportsmen would be entirely out of sight of the game.
The birds are so wild that to move a finger will frighten them.
&hellip;
</p>
<p>
"The decoys are wild geese which had been crippled and tamed for
this purpose. They are placed inside of silk net fences which are
located on each side of the holes dug for hiding places. These nets
are the color of the ground and it is impossible for the wild geese
flying overhead to detect the difference.
</p>
<p>
"After we had investigated everything the expert caller and owner of
the outfit exclaimed: 'Into your holes!'
</p>
<p>
"We noticed in the distance a flock of geese coming. Our caller in a
few seconds had their attention, and they headed towards our decoys.
Soon they were directly over us, but out of easy range of our guns.
We were anxious to shoot, but in obedience to our boss had to keep
still, and soon noticed that the birds were soaring around and in a
short time were within fifteen or twenty feet of us. At that moment
we heard the command, 'Punch 'em!' and the bombardment that followed
was beyond imagining. <i> We had fired five shots apiece and found
we had bagged ten geese from this one flock</i>.
</p>
<p>
"At the end of one hour's shooting we had 218 birds to our credit
and were out of ammunition.
</p>
<p>
"On finding that no more shells were in our pits we took our dead
geese to the camp and returned with a new supply of ammunition. We
remained in the pits during the entire day. When the sun had gone
behind the mountains we summed up our kill and <i> it amounted to
450 geese</i>!
</p>
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page149] </span> </a>
<p>
"The picture shown with this article gives a view of <i> the first
hour's shoot</i>. A photograph would have been taken of the
remainder of the shoot, but it being warm weather the birds had to
be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling.

"Supper was then eaten, after which we were driven back to Willows;
both agreeing that it was one of the greatest days of sport we ever
had, and wishing that we might, through the courtesy of the Glenn
County Goose Club, have another such day. C.H.B."
</p>
<p>
Another picture was published in a Canadian magazine, illustrating a
story from which I quote:
</p>
<p>
"I fixed the decoys, hid my boat and took my position in the blind.
My man started his work with a will and hustled the ducks out of
every cove, inlet or piece of marsh for two miles around. I had
barely time to slip the cartridges into my guns&mdash;<i>one a
double and the other a five shot automatic</i>&mdash;when I saw a
brace of birds coming toward me. They sailed in over my decoys. I
rose to the occasion, and the leader up-ended and tumbled in among
the decoys. The other bird, unable to stop quick enough, came
directly over me. He closed his wings and struck the ground in the
rear of the blind.
</p>
<p>
"More and more followed. Sometimes they came singly, and then in
twos <a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page150] </span> </a> and threes. I kept busy and attended to each
bird as quickly as possible. Whenever there was a lull in the flight
I went out in the boat and picked up the dead, leaving the wounded
to take chances with any gunner lucky enough to catch them in open
and smooth water. A bird handy in the air is worth two wounded ones
in the water. <i> Twice I took six dead birds out of the water for
seven shots, and both guns empty</i>.
</p>
<p>
"The ball thus opened, the birds commenced to move in all
directions. Until the morning's flight was over I was kept busy
pumping lead, <i> first with the 10, then with the automatic</i>,
reloading, picking up the dead, etc."
</p>
<p>
And the reader will observe that the harmless, innocent, inoffensive
automatic shot gun, that "don't matter if you enforce the bag
limit," figures prominently in both stories and both photographs.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="latin"> <i> A Story of Two Pump Guns and Geese: </i> </span> &mdash;It comes from Aberdeen, S.D. (Sand Lake), in the spring of 1911. Mr. J.J. Humphrey tells it, in <i> Outdoor Life </i> magazine for July, 1911.
</p>
<p>
"Smith and I were about a hundred yards from them [the flock of
Canada geese], when Murphy scared them. They rose in a dense mass
and came directly between Smith and me. We were about gunshot
distance apart, and they were not over thirty feet in the air when
we opened up on them with our pump guns and No. 5 shot. When the
smoke cleared away and we had rounded up the cripples we found we
had twenty-one geese. I have heard of bigger killings out in this
country, but never positively knew of them."
</p>
<p>
So then: <i> those two gunners averaged 10-1/2 wild geese per pump
gun out of one flock</i>! And yet there are wise and reflective
sportsmen who say, "What difference does the kind of gun make so
long as you live up to the law?"
</p>
<p>
I think that the pump and automatic guns make about 75 <i> per-cent
of difference, against the game</i>; that is all!
</p>
<p>
The number of shot-guns now in use in the United States is almost
beyond belief. About six years ago a gentleman interested in the
manufacture of such weapons informed me, and his statement has never
been disputed, that <i> every year </i> about 500,000 new shot-guns
were sold in the United States. The number of shot cartridges
annually produced by our four great cartridge companies has been
reliably estimated as follows:

We must stop all the holes in the barrel, or eventually lose all the
water. No group of bird-slaughterers is entitled to immunity. We
will not "limit the bag, and enforce the laws," while we permit the
makers and users of autoloading and pump guns to kill at will, as
they demand.

Yes; we <i> will </i> "limit the bag" and "enforce the laws;" but
the machine guns and the alien shooters shall be eliminated at the
same time! Each state has the power to regulate, absolutely, down to
the smallest detail, the manner in which the game of The People
shall be taken or not taken; and such laws are absolutely
constitutional. If we can legislate punt guns and dynamite out of
use, the machine guns and silencers can be treated similarly.
</p>
<p>
<i> No immunity for wild-life exterminators</i>.
</p>
<p>
The following unprejudiced testimony from a New York business man
who is a sportsman, with a fine game preserve of his own, should be
of general interest. It was written to G.O. Shields, March 21, 1906.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="list">
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps"> Dear Sir: </span>
	</p>
	<p>
Regarding the use of the automatic shot-gun, would say that I am a
member of two southern ducking clubs where these guns are used very
extensively. I have seen a flock of ducks come into a blind where
one, two, or even three of these guns were in use, and have seen as
many as eleven shots poured into a single flock.
	</p>
	<p>
We have considerable poaching on one of these clubs, the territory
being so extensive that it is impossible to prevent it. We own
60,000 acres, and these poachers, I am told, nearly all use the
automatic guns. They frequently kill six or eight ducks out of one
flock&mdash;first taking a raking shot on the water, and then
getting in the balance of the magazine before the flock is out of
range. In fact, some of them carry two guns, and are able to
discharge a part of the second magazine into the same flock.
	</p>
	<p>
As I told you the other evening, I am not so much against the gun
when in the hands of gentlemen and real sportsmen, but, on account
of its terrible possibilities for market hunters, I believe that the
only safe way is to abolish it entirely, and that the better class
should be willing to give up this weapon as being the only means of
putting a stop to this willful game slaughter.
	</p>
	<p>
Very truly yours,
	</p>

<p class="list">
	<span class="latin"> <i> The English 3-barrel "Scatter Rifle," for Ducks. </i> </span> &mdash;All gunners who find machine guns good enough for them will be delighted by the news that an Englishman whose identity is concealed under the initials "F.M.M." has invented and manufactured a 3-barreled rifle specially intended to kill ducks that are beyond the reach of a choke-bore shotgun. The weapon discharges all three barrels simultaneously. In the <i> London Field</i>, of Dec. 9, 1911, it is described by a writer who also thoughtfully conceals his identity under a nom-de-plume. After a trial of 48 shots, the writer declares that "the 3-barreled is a really practicable weapon," and that with it one could bag wild-fowl that were quite out of reach of any shot-gun. Just why a Gatling gun or a Maxim should not be employed for the same purpose, the writer fails to state. The use of either would be quite as sportsmanlike, and as fair to the game. There are great possibilities in ducking mortars, also.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="latin"> <i> The "Sunday Gun." </i> </span> &mdash;A new weapon of peculiar form and great deadliness to song birds, has recently come into use. Because of the manner of its use, it is known as the "Sunday gun." It is specially adapted to concealment on the person. A man could go through a reception with one of these deadly weapons absolutely concealed under his dress coat! It is a weapon with two barrels, rifle and shot; and it enables the user to kill anything from a humming-bird up to a deer. What the shot-barrel can not kill, the rifle will. It is not a gun that any sportsman would own, save as a curiosity, or for target use.
</p>
<p>
The State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, Mr. E.H. Forbush, informs
me that already the "Sunday gun" has become a scourge to the bird
life of that state. Thousands of them are used by men and boys who
live in <a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page154] </span> </a> cities and towns, and are able to get into
the country only on Sundays. They conceal them under their coats, on
Sunday mornings, go out into the country, and spend the day in
shooting small birds and mammals. The dead birds are concealed in
various pockets, the Sunday gun goes under the coat, and at
nightfall the guerrilla rides back to the city with an innocent
smile on his face, as if he had spent a day in harmless enjoyment of
the beauties of nature.
</p>
<p>
The "Sunday gun" is on sale everywhere, and it is said to be in use
both by American and Italian killers of song-birds. It weighs only
two pounds, eight ounces, and its cost is so trifling that any
guerrilla who wishes one can easily find the money for its purchase.
There are in the United States at least a million men and boys quite
mean enough to use this weapon on song-birds, swallows, woodpeckers,
nuthatches, rabbits and squirrels, and like other criminals, hide
both weapon and loot in their clothing. So long as this gun is in
circulation, no small bird is safe, at any season, near any city or
town.
</p>
<p>
Now, what are the People going to do about it?
</p>
<p>
My recommendation is that each state enact a law in the following
terms:
</p>
<p>
Be it enacted, etc.&mdash;That from and after the passage of this
act it shall be unlawful for any person to use in hunting, or to
carry concealed on the person, any shotgun, or rifle, or combination
of shotgun and rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than
twenty-eight inches in length, or with a skeleton stock fixed on a
hinge.
</p>
<p>
The carrying of any rifle or shotgun concealed on the person shall
constitute a felony.
</p>
<p>
The penalties for hunting with any gun specially adapted to
concealment should be not less than $50 fine or two months
imprisonment at hard labor, and the carrying of such weapons
concealed should be $100 or four months at hard labor.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, we wonder what will be the next devilish device for
the destruction of wild life that American inventive genius will
produce.

		CHAPTER XVI
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF NORTH AMERICAN BIG GAME
	</div>
</div>
<p>
The subject of this chapter opens up a vast field of facts and
conclusions, quite broad enough to fill a whole volume. In the space
at our disposal here it is possible to offer only a summary of the
subject, without attempting to prove our statements by the
production of detailed evidence.
</p>
<p>
To say that all over the world, the large land mammals are being
destroyed more rapidly than they are breeding, would not be
literally true, for the reason that there are yet many areas that
are almost untouched by the destroying hand of civilized man. It is
true, however, that all the unspoiled areas rapidly are growing
fewer and smaller. It is also true that in all the regions of the
earth that are easily penetrable by civilized man, the wild life is
being killed faster than it breeds, and of necessity it is
disappearing. This is why the British are now so urgently bestirring
themselves to create game preserves in all the countries that they
own.
</p>
<p>
It is one of the inexorable laws of Nature, to which I know of not
one exception, that large hoofed animals which live on open plains,
on open mountains, or in regions that are thinly forested, always
are easily found and easily exterminated. All such animals have a
weak hold on life. This is because it is so difficult for them to
hide, and so very easy for man to creep up within the killing range
of modern, high-power, long-range rifles. Is it not pitiful to think
of animals like the caribou, moose, white sheep and bear trying to
survive on the naked ridges and bald mountains of Yukon Territory
and Alaska! With a modern rifle, the greatest duffer on earth can
creep up within killing distance of any of the big game of the
North.
</p>
<p>
The gray wolf is practically the only large animal that is able to
hide successfully and survive in the treeless regions of the North;
but his room is always preferable to his company, because he, too,
is a destroyer of big game.
</p>
<p>
I am tempted to try to map out roughly what are to-day the unopened
and undestroyed wild haunts of big game in North America. In doing
this, however, I warn the reader not to be deceived into thinking
that because game still exists in those regions, those areas
therefore constitute a permanent preserve and safe breeding-ground
for large mammals. That is very, very far from being the case. The
further "opening up " of the <a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page157] </span> </a> wilderness areas, as I
shall call them for convenience, can and surely will quickly wipe
out their big game; for throughout nine-tenths of those areas it
holds to life by very slender threads.
</p>
<p>
To-day the unopened and undestroyed wilderness areas of North
America, wherein large mammals still live in a normal wild state,
are in general as follows:
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Arctic Barren Grounds </span> , or Arctic Prairies, north of the limit of trees, embracing the Barren Grounds of northern Canada, the great arctic archipelago, Ellesmere, Melville and Grant Lands and Greenland. This region is the home of the musk-ox and three species of arctic caribou.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Alaska-Yukon Region </span> , inhabited by the moose, white mountain sheep, mountain goat, four species of caribou, and half a dozen species of Alaska brown, grizzly and black bears.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Northern Ontario, Quebec, Labrador And Newfoundland </span> , inhabited by moose, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer and black bear.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> British Columbia </span> , inhabited by a magnificent big-game fauna embracing the moose, elk, caribou of two species, white sheep, black sheep, big-horn sheep, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, grizzly, black and inland white bears.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Sierra Madre Of Mexico </span> , containing jaguar, puma, grizzly and black bears, mule deer, white-tailed deer, antelope, mountain sheep and peccaries.
</p>
<p>
I have necessarily omitted all those regions of the United States
and Canada that still contain a remnant of big game, but have been
literally "shot to pieces" by gunners.
</p>
<p>
In the United States and southern Canada there are about fifteen
localities which contain a supply of big game sufficient that a
conscientious sportsman might therein hunt and kill one head per
year with a clear conscience. <i> All others should be closed for
five years</i>! Here is the list of availables; and regarding it
there will be about as many opinions as there are big-game
sportsmen:
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p class="centerheading">

</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p>
Under existing conditions I regard the above-named hunting grounds
as <i> nearly all </i> in which it is right or fair for big-game
hunting now to be permitted, even on a strict basis. Nearly all
others should immediately be closed, for large game, for ten years.
</p>
<p>
Of course such a proceeding, if carried into effect, would provoke
loud protests from sportsmen, gunners, game-hogs, pot-hunters and
others; but I only wish to high heaven that we had the power to
carry such a program as that into effect! <i> Then we would see some
game in ten years</i>; and our grand-children would thank us for
some real big-game protection at a critical period.
</p>
<p>
Except in the few localities above-mentioned, I regard the big-game
situation in the United States and southern Canada as particularly
desperate. Unless there is an immediate and complete revolution in
this country from an era of slaughter to an era of preservation, as
sure as the sun rises on the morrow, outside of the hard and fast
game preserves, and places like Maine and the Adirondacks, this
generation of Americans and near-Americans will live to see our
country <i> swept clean of big game</i>!
</p>
<p>
Two years ago, I did not believe this; but I do now. It is
impossible to exaggerate the wide extent or the seriousness of this
situation. In a country where any and every individual can rise and
bluster, "I'm-just-as-good-as-<i>you</i>-are," and bellow for his
"rights" as a "tax-payer," there is no stopping the millions who
kill whenever there is an open season. And to many Americans, no
right is dearer than the right to kill the game which by even the
commonest law of equity belongs, not to the shooter exclusively, but
partly to two thousand other persons who don't shoot at all!
</p>
<p>
Unless we come to an "About, face!" in quick time, all our big game
outside the preserves is doomed to sure and quick extermination.
This is not an individual opinion, merely: it is a <i> fact</i>; and
a hundred thousand men know it to be such.
</p>
<p>
Last winter (1911-12), because the deer of Montana were driven by
cold and hunger out of the mountains and far down into the
ranchmen's <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page159] </span> </a> valleys, eleven thousand of them were
ruthlessly slaughtered. State Game Warden Avare says that often
heads of families took out as many licenses as there were persons in
the family, and the whole quota was killed. Such people deserve to
go deerless into the future; but we can not allow them to rob
innocent people.
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p class="centerheading">
	OUR SPECIES OF BIG GAME
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Prong-Horned Antelope </span> , unique and wonderful, will be one of <i> the first species of North American big game to become totally extinct</i>. We may see this come to pass within twenty years. They can not be bred in protection, <i> save in very large fenced ranges</i>. They are delicate, capricious, and easily upset. They die literally "at the drop of a hat." They are quite subject to actinomycosis (lumpy-jaw), which in wild animals is incurable.
</p>
<p>
Already all the states that possess wild antelope, except Nevada,
have passed laws giving that species long close seasons; which is
highly creditable to the states that have done their duty. Nevada
must get in line at the next session of her legislature!
</p>
<p>
In 1908, Dr. T.S. Palmer published in his annual report of "Progress
in Game Protection" the following in regard to the prong-horned
antelope:
</p>
<p>
"Antelope are still found in diminished numbers in fourteen western
states. A considerable number were killed during the year in
Montana, where the species seems to have suffered more than
elsewhere since the season was opened in 1907.
</p>
<p>
"A striking illustration of the decrease of the antelope is afforded
by Colorado. In 1898 the State Warden estimated that there were
25,000 in the state, whereas in 1908 the Game Commissioner places
the number at only 2,000. The total number of antelope now in the
United States probably does not exceed 17,000, distributed
approximately as follows:

To-day (1912), Dr. Palmer says the total number of antelope is less
than it was in 1908, and in spite of protection the number is
steadily diminishing. This is indeed serious news. The existing
bands, already small, are steadily growing smaller. The antelope are
killed lawlessly, and the crimes of such slaughter are, in nearly
every instance, successfully concealed.
</p>
<p>
Previously, we have based strong hopes for the preservation of the
antelope species on the herd in the Yellowstone Park, but those
animals are vanishing fearfully fast. In 1906, Dr. Palmer reported
that "About fifteen hundred antelope came down to the feeding
grounds near the haystacks in the vicinity of Gardiner." In 1908 the
Yellowstone Park <a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page160] </span> </a> was credited with two
thousand head. <i> To-day, the number alive, by actual count, is
only five hundred head</i>; and this after twenty-five years of
protection! Where have the others gone? This shows, alas! that
perpetual close seasons can not <i> always </i> bring back the
vanished thousands of game!

	PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE
</p>
<p>
Here is a reliable report (June 29, 1912) regarding the prong-horned
antelope in Lower California, from E.W. Nelson: "Antelope formerly
ranged over nearly the entire length of Lower California, but are
now gone from a large part of their ancient range, and their
steadily decreasing numbers indicate their early extinction
throughout the peninsula."
</p>
<p>
In captivity the antelope is exasperatingly delicate and
short-lived. It has about as much stamina as a pet monkey. As an
exhibition animal in zoological gardens and parks it is a failure;
for it always looks faded, spiritless and dead, like a stuffed
animal ready to be thrown into the discard. Zoologists can not save
the prong-horn species save at long range, in preserves so huge that
the sensitive little beast will not even suspect that it is
confined.
</p>
<p>
Two serious attempts have been made to transplant and acclimatize
the <a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page161] </span> </a> antelope&mdash;in the Wichita National Bison
Range, in Oklahoma, and in the Montana Bison Range, at Ravalli. In
1911 the Boone and Crockett Club provided a fund which defrayed the
expenses of shipping from the Yellowstone Park a small nucleus herd
to each of those ranges. Eight were sent to the Wichita Range, of
which five arrived alive. Of the seven sent to the Montana Range,
four arrived alive and were duly set free. While it seems a pity to
take specimens from the Yellowstone Park herd, the disagreeable fact
is that there is no other source on which to draw for breeding
stock.
</p>
<p>
The Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, in Canada, still permit
the hunting and killing of antelope; which is wholly and entirely
wrong.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Big-Horn Sheep. </span> &mdash;Of North American big game, the big-horn of the Rockies will be, after the antelope, the next species to become extinct outside of protected areas. In the United States that event is fast approaching. It is far nearer than even the big-game sportsmen realize. There are to-day only two localities in the four states that still <i> think </i> they have killable sheep, in which it is worth while to go sheep-hunting. One is in Montana, and the other is in Wyoming. In the United States a really big, creditable ram may now be regarded as an impossibility. There are now perhaps half a dozen guides who can find killable sheep in our country, but the game is nearly always young rams, under five years of age.
</p>
<p>
That Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Washington still continue to permit
sheep slaughter is outrageous. Their answer is that "The sportsmen
won't stand for stopping it altogether." I will add:&mdash;and the
great mass of people are too criminally indifferent to take a hand
in the matter, and <i> do their duty </i> regardless of the men of
blood.
</p>
<p>
The seed stock of big-horn sheep now alive in the United States
aggregates a pitifully small number. After twenty-five years of
unbroken protection in Colorado, Dillon Wallace estimates, after an
investigation on the ground, that the state possesses perhaps
thirty-five hundred head. He credits Montana and Wyoming with five
hundred each&mdash;which I think is far too liberal a number. I do
not believe that either of those states contains more than one
hundred unprotected sheep, at the very utmost limit. If there are
more, where are they?
</p>
<p>
In the Yellowstone Park there are 210 head, safe and sound, and
slowly increasing. I can not understand why they have not increased
more rapidly than they have. In Glacier Park, now under permanent
protection, three guides on Lake McDonald, in 1910, estimated the
number of sheep at seven hundred. Idaho has in her rugged Bitter
Root and Clearwater Mountains and elsewhere, a remnant of possibly
two hundred sheep, and Washington has only what chemists call "a
trace." It has recently been discovered that California still
contains a few sheep, and in southwestern Nevada there are a few
more.
</p>
<p>
In Utah, the big-horn species is probably quite extinct. In Arizona,
there are a few very small bands, very widely scattered. They are in
the Santa Catalina Mountains, the Grand Canyon country, the Gila
Range, and <a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page162] </span> </a> the Quitovaquita Mountains, near Sonoyta.
But who can protect from slaughter those Arizona sheep? Absolutely
no one! They are too few and too widely scattered for the game
wardens to keep in touch with them. The "prospectors" have them
entirely at their mercy, and the world well knows what prospectors'
"mercy" to edible big game looks like on the ground. It leads
straight to the frying-pan, the coyotes and the vultures.
</p>
<p>
The Lower California peninsula contains about five hundred mountain
sheep, without the slightest protection save low, desert mountains,
heat and thirst. But that is no real protection whatever. Those
sheep are too fine to be butchered the way they have been, and now
are being butchered. In 1908 I strongly called the attention of the
Mexican Government to the situation; and the Departmento de Fomento
secured the issue of an executive order forbidding the hunting of
any big game in Lower California without the written authority of
the government. I am sure, however, that owing to the political and
military upheaval it never stopped the slaughter of sheep. In such
easy mountains as those of Lower California, it is a simple matter
to exterminate quickly all the mountain sheep that they possess. The
time for President Madero and his cabinet to inaugurate serious
protective measures has fully arrived.
</p>
<p>
Both British Columbia and Alberta have even yet fine herds of
big-horn, and we can count three large game preserves in which they
are protected. They are Goat Mountain Park (East Kootenay district,
between the Elk and Bull Rivers); the Rocky Mountains Park, near
Banff, and Waterton Lakes Park, in the southwestern corner of
Alberta.
</p>
<p>
In view of the number of men who desire to hunt them, the bag limit
on big-horn rams in British Columbia and Alberta still is too
liberal, by half. One ram per year for one man is <i> quite
enough</i>; quite as much so as one moose is the limit everywhere.
To-day "a big, old ram" is regarded by sportsmen as a much more
desirable and creditable trophy than a moose; because moose-killing
is easy, and the bagging of an old mountain ram in real mountains
requires five times as much effort and skill.
</p>
<p>
The splendid high and rugged mountains of British Columbia and
Alberta form an ideal home for the big-horn (and mountain goat), and
it would be an international calamity for that region to be denuded
of its splendid big game. With resolute intent and judicial
treatment that region can remain a rich and valuable hunting ground
for five hundred years to come. Under falsely "liberal" laws, it can
be shot into a state of complete desolation within ten years, or
even less.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Other Mountain Sheep. </span> &mdash;In northern British Columbia, north of Iskoot Lake, there lies a tremendous region, extending to the Arctic Ocean, and comprehending the whole area between the Rocky Mountain continental divide and the waters of the Pacific. Over the southern end of this great wilderness ranges the black mountain sheep, and throughout the remainder, with many sheepless intervals, is scattered the white mountain sheep.
</p>
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page163] </span> </a>
<p>
Owing to the immensity of this wilderness, the well-nigh total lack
of railroads and also of navigable waters, excepting the Yukon, it
will not be thoroughly "opened up" for a quarter of a century. The
few resolute and pneumonia-proof sportsmen who can wade into the
country, pulling boats through icy-cold mountain streams, are not
going to devastate those millions of mountains of their big game.
The few head of game which sportsmen can and will take out of the
great northwestern wilderness during the next twenty-five years will
hardly be missed from the grand total, even though a few
easily-accessible localities are shot out. It is the deadly resident
trappers, hunters and prospectors who must be feared! And
again,&mdash;<i>who </i> can control them? Can any wilderness
government on earth make it possible? Therefore, <i> in time, even
the great wilderness will be denuded of big game</i>. This is
absolutely fixed and certain; for within much less than another
century, every square rod of it will have been gone over by
prospectors, lumbermen, trappers and skin-hunters, and raked again
and again with fine-toothed combs. A railway line to Dawson, the
Copper River and Cook Inlet is to-day merely the next thing to
expect, after Canada's present railway program has been wrought out.
</p>
<p>
Yes, indeed! In time the wilderness will be opened up, and the big
game will <i> all </i> be shot out, save from the protected areas.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Mountain Goat. </span> &mdash;Even yet, this species is not wholly extinct in the United States. It survives in Glacier Park, Montana, and the number estimated in that region by three guide friends is too astoundingly large to mention.
</p>
<p>
This animal is much more easily killed than the big-horn. Its white
coat renders it fatally conspicuous at long range during the best
hunting season; it is almost devoid of fear, and it takes altogether
too many chances on man. Thanks to the rage for sheep horns, the
average sportsman's view-point regarding wild life ranks a goat head
about six contours below "old ram" heads, in desirability.
Furthermore, most guides regard the flesh of the goat as almost
unfit for use as food, and far inferior to that of the big-horn.
These reasons, taken together, render the goats much less persecuted
by the sportsmen, ranchmen and prospectors who enter the home of the
two species. It was because of this indifference toward goats that
in 1905 Mr. John M. Phillips and his party saw 243 goats in thirty
days in Goat Mountain Park, and only fourteen sheep.
</p>
<p>
Unless the preferences of western sportsmen and gunners change very
considerably, the coast mountains of the great northwestern
wilderness will remain stocked with wild mountain goats until long
after the last big-horn has been shot to death. Fortunately, the
skin of the mountain goat has no commercial value. I think it was in
1887 that I purchased, in Denver, 150 nicely tanned skins of our
wild white goat <i> at fifty cents each</i>! They were wanted for
the first exhibit ever made to illustrate the extermination of
American large mammals, and they were shown at the Louisville
Exposition. It must have cost the price of those skins to tan them;
and I was pleased to know that some one lost money on the venture.

<p>
At present the mountain goat extends from north-western Montana to
the head of Cook Inlet, but it is not found in the interior or in
the Yukon valley. Whenever man decides that the species has lived
long enough, he can quickly and easily exterminate it. It is one of
the most picturesque and interesting wild animals on this continent,
and there is not the slightest excuse for shooting it, save as a
specimen of natural history. Like the antelope, it is so unique as a
natural curiosity that it deserves to be taken out of the ranks of
animals that are regularly pursued as game.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Elk. </span> &mdash;The story of the progressive extermination of the American elk, or wapiti, covers practically the same territory as the tragedy of the American bison&mdash;one-third of the mainland of North America. The former range of the elk covered absolutely the garden ground of our continent, omitting the arid region. Its boundary extended from central Massachusetts to northern Georgia, southern Illinois, northern Texas and central New Mexico, central Arizona, the whole Rocky Mountain region up to the Peace River, and Manitoba. It skipped the arid country west of the Rockies, but it embraced practically the whole Pacific slope from central California to the north end of Vancouver Island. Mr. Seton <a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page165] </span> </a> roughly calculated the former range of <i> canadensis </i> at two and a half million square miles, and adds: "We are safe, therefore, in believing that in those days there may have been ten million head."
</p>
<p>
The range of the elk covered a magnificent domain. The map prepared
by Mr. Ernest T. Seton, after twenty years of research, is the last
word on the subject. It appears on page 43, Vol. I, of his great
work, "Life Histories of Northern Animals," and I have the
permission of author and publisher to reproduce it here, as an
object lesson in wild-animal extermination. Mr. Seton recognizes
(for convenience, only?) four forms of American elk, two of which,
<i> C. nannodes </i> and <i> occidentalis</i>, still exist on the
Pacific Coast. The fourth, <i> Cervus merriami</i>, was undoubtedly
a valid species. It lived in Arizona and New Mexico, but became
totally extinct near the beginning of the present century.
</p>
<p>
In 1909 Mr. Seton published in the work referred to above a
remarkably close estimate of the number of elk then alive in North
America. Recently, a rough count&mdash;the first ever made&mdash;of
the elk in and around the Yellowstone Park, revealed the real number
of that largest contingent. By taking those results, and Mr. Seton's
figures for elk outside the United States, we obtain the following
very close approximation of the wild elk alive in North America in
1912:

<p>
In 1905, a herd of twenty of the so-called dwarf elk of the San
Joaquin Valley, California, were taken to the Sequoia National Park,
and placed in a fenced range that had been established for it on the
Kaweah River.
</p>
<p>
The extermination of the wapiti began with the settlement of the
American colonies. Naturally, the largest animals were the ones most
eagerly sought by the meat-hungry pioneers, and the elk and bison
were the first game species to disappear. The colonists believed in
the survival of the fittest, and we are glad that they did. The one
thing that a hungry pioneer cannot withstand
is&mdash;temptation&mdash;in a form that embraces five hundred
pounds of succulent flesh. And let it not be supposed that in the
eastern states there were only a few elk. The Pennsylvania salt
licks were crowded with them, and the early writers describe them as
existing in "immense bands" and "great numbers."
</p>
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page166] </span> </a>
<p>
Of course it is impossible for wild animals of great size to exist
in countries that are covered with farms, villages and people. Under
such conditions the wild and the tame cannot harmonize. It is a
fact, however, that elk could exist and thrive in every national
forest and national park in our country, and also on uncountable
hundreds of thousands of rough, wild, timbered hills and mountains
such as exist in probably twenty-five different states. There is no
reason, except man's short-sighted greed and foolishness, why there
are not to-day one hundred thousand elk living in the Allegheny
Mountains, furnishing each year fifty thousand three-year-old males
as free food for the people.
</p>
<p>
The trouble is,&mdash;the greedy habitants <i> could not </i> be
induced to kill only the three-year-old-males, in the fall, and let
the cows, calves and breeding bulls alone! By sensible management
the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast Range would
support enough wild elk to feed a million people. But we Americans
seem utterly incapable of maintaining anywhere from decade to decade
a large and really valuable supply of wild game. Outside the
Yellowstone Park and northwestern Wyoming, the American elk exists
only in small bands&mdash;mere remnants and samples of the millions
we could and should have.
</p>
<p>
<i> If </i> they could be protected, and the surplus presently
killed according to some rational, working system, then <i> every
national forest in the United States should be stocked with elk</i>!
In view of the awful cost of beef (to-day 10-1/2 cents per pound in
Chicago <i> on the hoof</i>!), it is high time that we should
consider the raising of game on the public domain on such lines that
it would form a valuable food supply without diminishing the value
of the forests.
</p>
<p>
Just now (1912) the American people are sorely puzzled by a
remarkable elk problem that each winter is presented for solution in
the Jackson Hole country, Wyoming. Driven southward by the deep
snows of winter, the elk thousands that in summer graze and grow fat
in the Yellowstone Park march down into Jackson Hole, to find in
those valleys less snow and more food. Now, it happens that the best
and most of the former winter grazing grounds of the elk are covered
by fenced ranches! As a result, the elk that strive to winter there,
about fifteen thousand head, are each winter threatened with
starvation; and during three or four winters of recent date, an
aggregate of several thousand calves, weak yearlings and weakened
cows perished of hunger. The winters of 1908, 1909 and 1910 were
progressively more and more severe; and 1911 saw about 2500 deaths,
(S.N. Leek).
</p>
<p>
In 1909-10, the State of Wyoming spent $7,000 for hay, and fed it to
the starving elk. In 1911, Wyoming spent $5,000 more, and appealed
to Congress for help. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Lodge and
others, Congress instantly responded with a splendid emergency
appropriation of $20,000, partly for the purpose of feeding the elk,
and also to meet the cost of transporting elsewhere as many of the
elk as it might seem best to move. The starving of the elk ceased
with 1911.
</p>
<p>
<i> Outdoor Life </i> magazine (Denver, Colo.) for August, 1912,
contains an <a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page167] </span> </a> excellent article by Dr. W.B. Shore,
entitled, "Trapping and Shipping Elk." I wish I could reprint it
entire, for the solid information that it contains. It gives a clear
and comprehensive account of last spring's operations by the
Government and by the state of Montana in capturing and shipping elk
from the Yellowstone Park herd, for the double purpose of
diminishing the elk surplus in the Park and stocking vacant ranges
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
The operations were conducted on the same basis as the shipping of
cattle&mdash;the corral, the chute, the open car, and the car-load
in bulk. Dr. Shore states that the undertaking was really no more
difficult than the shipping of range cattle; but the presence of a
considerable proportion of young and tender calves, such as are
never handled with beef cattle, led to 8.8 per cent of deaths in
transit. The deaths and the percentage are nothing at which to be
surprised, when it is remembered, that the animals had just come
through a hard winter, and their natural vitality was at the lowest
point of the year.

In order to provide adequate winter grazing grounds for the
Yellowstone-Wyoming elk, it seems imperative that the national
government should expend between $30,000 and $40,000 in buying back
from ranchmen certain areas in the Jackson valley, particularly a
tract known as "the swamp," and others on the surrounding foothills
where the herds annually go to graze in winter, A measure to render
this possible was presented to Congress in the winter of 1912, and
without opposition an appropriation of $45,000 was made.
</p>
<p>
The splendid photographs of the elk herds that recently have been
made <a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page168] </span> </a> by S.N. Leek, of Jackson Hole, clearly
reveal the fact that the herds now consist chiefly of cows, calves,
yearlings and young bulls with small antlers. In one photograph
showing about twenty-five hundred elk, there are not visible even
half a dozen pairs of antlers that belong to adult bulls. There
should be a hundred! This condition means that the best bulls, with
the finest heads, are constantly being selected and killed by
sportsmen and others who want their heads; and the young, immature
bulls are left to do the breeding that alone will sustain the
species.

<p>
It is a well-known principle in stock-breeding that sires should be
fully adult, of maximum strength, and in the prime of life. No
stockbreeder in his senses ever thinks of breeding from a youthful,
immature sire. The result would be weak offspring not up to the
standard.
</p>
<p>
This inexorable law of inheritance and transmission is just as much
a law for the elk, moose and deer of North America as it is for
domestic cattle and horses. If the present conditions in the Wyoming
elk herds continue to prevail for several generations, as sure as
time goes on we shall see a marked deterioration in the size and
antlers of the elk.
</p>
<p>
If the foundation principles of stock-breeding are correct, then it
is impossible to maintain any large-mammal species at its zenith of
size, strength and virility by continuous breeding of the young and
immature males. By some sportsmen it is believed that through
long-continued killing of the finest and largest males, the red deer
of Europe have been growing smaller; but on that point I am not
prepared to offer evidence.
</p>
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page169] </span> </a>
<p>
In regard to the in-breeding of the elk herds in large open parks
and preserves throughout North America, there are positively <i> no
ill effects to fear</i>. Wild animals that are <i> closely </i>
confined generation after generation are bound to deteriorate
physically; but with healthy wild animals living in large open
ranges, feeding and breeding naturally, the in-breeding that occurs
produces no deterioration.
</p>
<p>
In the twin certainties of over-population, and deterioration from
excessive killing of the good sires, we have to face two new
problems of very decided importance. Nothing short of very radical
measures will provide a remedy. For the immediate future, I can
offer a solution. While it seems almost impossible deliberately to
kill females, I think that the present is a very exceptional case,
and one that compels us to apply the painful remedy that I now
propose.

<p>
<i> Conclusion</i>:&mdash;For five years, entirely prohibit the
killing of adult male elk, and kill only females, and young males.
This would gradually diminish the number of calves born each year,
by about 2,500, and by the end of five years it would reduce the
number, <i> and the annual birth</i>, of females to a figure
sufficiently limited that the herds could be maintained on existing
ranges.
</p>
<p>
<i> Corollary</i>.&mdash;At the end of five years, stop killing
females, and kill only <i> young </i> males. This plan would permit
a large number of bull elk to mature; and then the largest and
strongest animals would do the breeding,&mdash;just as Nature always
intends shall be done.

	South America
</p>
<p>
Of all the big-game regions of the earth, South America is the
poorest. Of hoofed game she possesses only a dozen species that are
worth the attention of sportsmen; and like all other animal life in
that land of little game, they are desperately hard to find. In
South America you must work your heart out in order to get either
game or specimens that will be worth showing.
</p>
<p>
At present, we need not worry about the marsh deer, the pampas deer,
the guemal, or the venado, nor the tapir, jaguar, ocelot and bears.
All these species are abundantly able to take care of themselves;
and to find and kill any one of them is a man's task. In Patagonia
the natives do wastefully slaughter the guanacos; and there are
times also when great numbers of guanacos come down in winter to
certain mountain lakes, presumably in search of food, and perish by
hundreds through starvation. (H. Hesketh Prichard.)

	Mexico
</p>
<p>
About ten years more will see the extinction of the mountain sheep
of Lower California,&mdash;in the wake of the recently exterminated
Mexican <a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page170] </span> </a> sheep of the Santa Maria Lakes region. In
1908, I solemnly warned the government of President Diaz, and at
that time the Mexican government expressed much concern.
</p>
<p>
It is a great pity that just now political conditions are completely
estopping wild-life protection in Mexico; but it is true. If the
code of proposed laws that I drew up (by request) in 1908 and
submitted to Minister Molina were adopted, it would have a good
effect on the fauna of Mexico.
</p>
<p>
In Mexico there is little hoofed game to kill,&mdash;deer of the
white-tail groups, seven or eight species; the desert mule deer; the
brocket; the prong-horned antelope, the mountain sheep and the
peccary. The deer will not so easily be exterminated, but the
antelope and sheep will be utterly destroyed. They will be the first
to go; and I think they can not by any possibility last longer than
ten years. Is it not too bad that Mexico should permit her finest
species of hoofed and horned game to be obliterated before she
awakens to the desirability of conservation! The Mexicans could
protect their small stock of big game if they would; but in Lower
California they are leasing huge tracts of land to cattle companies,
and they permit the lessees to kill all the wild game they please on
their leased lands, even with the aid of dogs. This is a vicious and
fatal system, and contrary to all the laws of nations.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The White-Tailed Deer. </span> &mdash;Five hundred years hence, when the greed and rapacity of "civilized" man has completed the loot and ruin of the continent of North America, the white-tailed deer will be the last species of our big game to be exterminated. Its mental traits, its size, its color and its habits all combine to render it the most persistent of our large animals, and the best fitted to survive. It neither bawls nor bugles to attract its enemies, it can not be called to a sportsman, like the moose, and it sticks to its timber with rare and commendable closeness. When it sees a strange living thing walking erect, it does not stop to stare and catch soft-nosed bullets, but dashes away in quest of solitude.
</p>
<p>
The worst shooting that I ever did or saw done at game was at
running white-tailed deer, in the Montana river bottoms.
</p>
<p>
For the reasons given, the white-tail exists and persists in a
hundred United States localities from which all other big game save
the black bear have been exterminated. For example, in our
Adirondacks the moose were exterminated years and years ago, but the
beloved wilderness called the "North Woods" still is populated by
about 20,000 deer, and about 8,000 are killed annually. The deer of
Maine are sufficiently numerous that in 1909 a total of 15,879 were
killed. With some assistance from the thin sprinkling of moose and
caribou, the deer of Maine annually draw into that state, for
permanent dedication, a huge sum of money, variously estimated at
from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. In spite of heavy slaughter, and
vigorous attempts at extermination by over-shooting, the deer of
northern Michigan obstinately refuse to be wiped out.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, a large group of states in which this species has
been exterminated. The states comprising it are Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa, and adjacent portions of seven other states.
</p>
<p>
As if to shame the people of Iowa, a curious deer episode is
recorded. In 1885, W.B. Cuppy, of Avoca, Iowa, purchased five deer,
and placed them in a paddock on his 600-acre farm. By 1900 they had
increased to 32 head; and then one night some one kindly opened the
gate of their enclosure, and gave them the freedom of the city. Mr.
Cuppy made no effort to capture them, possibly because they decided
to annex his farm as their habitat. When a neighbor led them with a
bait of corn to their owner's door, he declined to impound them, on
the ground that it was unnecessary.
</p>
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page172] </span> </a>
<p>
By 1912, those deer had increased to 400, and the portion of this
story that no one will believe is this: they spread all through the
suburbs and hinterland farms of Avoca, and <i> the people not only
failed to assassinate all of them and eat them, but they actually
killed only a few, protected the rest, and made pets of many! </i>
Queer people, those men and boys of Avoca. Nearly everywhere else in
the world that I know, that history would have been ended
differently. Here in the East, 90 per cent of our people are like
the Avocans, but the other 10 per cent think only of slaying and
eating, sans mercy, sans decency, sans law. Now the State of Iowa
has taken hold, to capture some of those deer, and set them free in
other portions of the state.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere I shall note the quick and thorough success with which the
white-tailed deer has been brought back in Vermont, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and southern New York.
</p>
<p>
No state having waste lands covered with brush or timber need be
without the ubiquitous white-tailed deer. Give them a semblance of a
fair show, and they will live and breed with surprising fecundity
and persistence. If you start a park herd with ten does, soon you
will have more deer than you will know how to dispose of, unless you
market them under a Bayne law, duly tagged by the state. In close
confinement this species fares rather poorly. In large preserves it
does well, but during the rutting season the bucks are to be
dreaded; and those that develop aggressive traits should be shot and
marketed. This is the only way in which the deer parks of England
are kept safe for unarmed people.
</p>
<p>
Dr. T.S. Palmer has taken much pains to ascertain the number of deer
killed in the eastern United States. His records, as published in
May, 1910, are as follows:

<p>
At this date deer hunting is not permitted at any time in Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas,&mdash;where there are no wild
deer; nor in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Tennessee or
Kentucky. The long <a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page173] </span> </a> close seasons in
Massachusetts, Connecticut and southern New York have caused a great
migration of deer into those once-depopulated regions,&mdash;in
fact, right down to tide-water.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Mule Deer. </span> &mdash;This will be the first member of the Deer Family to become extinct in North America outside of the protected portions of its haunts. Its fatal preference for open ground and its habit of pausing to stare at the hunter have been, and to the end will be, its undoing. Possibly there are now two of these deer in the United States and British Columbia for every 98 that existed forty years ago, but no more. It is a deer of the bad lands and foothills, and its curiosity is fatal.
</p>
<p>
The number of sportsmen who have hunted and killed this fine animal
in its own wild and picturesque bad-lands is indeed quite small. It
has been four-fifths exterminated by the resident hunter and
ranchman, and to-day is found in the Rocky Mountain region most
sparingly. Ten years ago it seemed right to hunt the so-called Rocky
Mountain "black-tail" in northwestern Montana, because so many deer
were there it did not seem to spell extermination. Now, conditions
have changed. Since last winter's great slaughter in northwestern
Montana, of 11,000 hungry deer, the species has been so reduced that
it is no longer right to kill mule deer anywhere in our country, and
a universal close season for five years is the duty of every state
which contains that species.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Real Black-Tailed Deer, </span> of the Pacific coast, (<i>Odocoileus columbianus</i>) is, to most sportsmen of the Rocky Mountains and the East actually less known than the okapi! Not one out of every hundred of them can recognize a mounted head of it at sight. It is a small, delicately-formed, delicately-antlered understudy of the big mule deer, and now painfully limited in its distribution. It is <i> the </i> deer of California and western Oregon, and it has been so ruthlessly slaughtered that today it is going fast. As conditions stand to-day, and without a radical change on the part of the people of the Pacific coast, this very interesting species is bound to disappear. It will not be persistent, like the white-tailed deer, but in the heavy forests, it will last much longer than the mule deer.
</p>
<p>
My information regarding this deer is like the stock of specimens of
it in museum collections,&mdash;meager and unsatisfactory. We need
to know in detail how that species is faring to-day, and what its
prospects are for the immediate future. In 1900, I saw great piles
of skins from it in the fur houses of Seattle, and the sight gave me
much concern.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Caribou, Generally. </span> &mdash;I think it is not very difficult to forecast the future of the Genus <i> Rangifer </i> in North America, from the logic of the conditions of to-day. Thanks to the splendid mass of information that has been accumulated regarding this group, we are able to draw certain conclusions. I think that the caribou of the Canadian Barren Grounds and northeastern Alaska will survive in great numbers for at least another century; that the caribou herds of Newfoundland will last nearly as long, and that in fifty years or less all the caribou of the great northwestern wilderness will be swept away.
</p>
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page174] </span> </a>
<p>
The reasons for these conclusions are by no means obscure, or
farfetched.
</p>
<p>
In the first place, the barren-ground caribou are to-day enormously
numerous,&mdash;undoubtedly running up into millions. It can not be
possible that they are being killed faster than they are breeding;
and so they must be increasing. Their food supply is unlimited. They
are protected by two redoubtable champions,&mdash;Jack Frost and the
Mosquito. Their country never will contain a great human population.
The natives are so few in number, and so lazy, that even though they
should become supplied with modern firearms, it is unlikely that
they ever will make a serious impression on the caribou millions.
The only thing to fear for the barren-ground caribou throngs is
disease,&mdash;a factor that is beyond human prediction.
</p>
<p>
It is reasonably certain that the Barren Grounds never will be
netted by railways,&mdash;unless gold is discovered over a wide
area. The fierce cold and hunger, and the billions of mosquitoes of
the Barren Grounds will protect the caribou from the wholesale
slaughter that "civilized" man joyously would inflict&mdash;if he
had the chance.
</p>
<p>
The caribou thousands of Newfoundland are fairly accessible to
sportsmen and pot-hunters, but at the same time the colonial
government can protect them from extermination if it will. Already
much has been done to check the reckless and wicked slaughter that
once prevailed. A bag limit of three bull caribou per annum has been
fixed, which is enforced as to non-residents and sportsmen, but in a
way that is much too "American" it is often ignored by residents in
touch with the game. For instance, the guide of a New York gentleman
whom I know admitted to my friend that each year he killed "about
25" caribou for himself and his family of four other persons. He
explained thus: "When the inspector comes around, I show him two
caribou hanging in my woodshed, but back in the woods I have a
little shack where I keep the others until I want them."

The real sportsmen of the world never will make the slightest
perceptible impression on the caribou of Newfoundland. For one
thing, the hunting is much too tame to be interesting. If the
caribou of that Island ever are exterminated, it will be strictly by
the people of Newfoundland, themselves. If the government will
tighten its grip on the herds, they need never be exterminated.
</p>
<p>
The caribou of New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario are few and widely
scattered. Unless carefully conserved, they are not likely to last
long; for their country is annually penetrated in every direction by
armed men, white and red. There is no means by which it can be
proven, but from the number of armed men in those regions I feel
sure that the typical woodland caribou species is being shot faster
than it is breeding. The sportsmen and naturalists of Canada and New
Brunswick would render good service by making a close and careful
investigation of that question.
</p>
<p>
The caribou of the northwestern wilderness are in a situation
peculiarly their own. They inhabit a region of naked mountains and
<i> thin </i> forests, <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page175] </span> </a> wherein they are
conspicuous, easily stalked and easily killed. Nowhere do they exist
in large herds of thousands, or even of many hundreds. They live in
small bands of from ten to twenty head, and even those are far
apart. The region in which they live is certain to be thoroughly
opened up by railways, and exploited. Fifty years from now we will
find every portion of the now-wild Northwest fairly accessible by
rail. The building of the railways will be to the caribou&mdash;and
to other big game&mdash;the day of doom. In that wild, rough region,
no power on earth,&mdash;save that which might be able to deprive
<i> all </i> the inhabitants and all visitors of firearms,&mdash;can
possibly save the game outside of a few preserves that are
diligently patroled.
</p>
<p>
The big game of the northwest region, in which I include the
interior of Alaska, <i> will go</i>! It is only a question of time.
Already the building of the city of Fairbanks, and the exploitation
of the mining districts surrounding it, have led to such harassment
and slaughter of the migrating caribou that the great herd which
formerly traversed the Tanana country once a year has completely
changed its migration route, and now keeps much farther north. The
"crossing" of the Yukon near Eagle City has been abandoned. A
hundred years hence, the northwestern wilderness will be dotted with
towns and criss-crossed with railways; but the big game of it will
be gone, except in the preserves that are yet to be made. This will
particularly involve the caribou, moose, and mountain sheep of all
species, which will be the first to go. The mountain goat and the
forest bears will hold out longer than their more exposed neighbors
of the treeless mountains.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Moose. </span> &mdash;In the United States the moose is found in five states,&mdash;Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. There are 550 in the Yellowstone Park. In Maine and Minnesota only may moose be hunted and killed. In the season of 1909, 184 moose were killed in Maine,&mdash;a large number, considering the small moose population of that state. In northern Minnesota, we now possess a great national moose preserve of 909,743 acres; and in 1908 Mr. Fullerton, after a personal inspection in which he saw 189 moose in nine days, estimated the total moose population of the present day at 10,000 head. This is a moose preserve worth while.
</p>
<p>
Outside of protected areas, the moose is the animal that is most
easily exterminated. Its trail is easily followed, and its habits
are thoroughly known, down to three decimal places. As a hunter's
reward it is Great. Strange to say, New Brunswick has found that the
moose is an animal that it is possible, and even easy, to protect.
The death of a moose is an event that is not easily concealed!
Wherever it is thoroughly understood that the moose law will be
enforced, the would-be poacher pauses to consider the net results to
him of a jail sentence.
</p>
<p>
In New Brunswick we have seen two strange things happen, during our
own times. We have seen the moose migrate into, and permanently
occupy, an extensive area that previously was destitute of that
species. At the <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page176] </span> </a> same time, we have seen a
reasonable number of bull moose killed by sportsmen without
disturbing in the least the general equanimity of the general moose
population! And at this moment, the moose population of New
Brunswick is almost incredible. Every moose hunter who goes there
sees from 20 to 40 moose, and two of my friends last year saw, "in
round numbers, about 100!" Up to date the size of adult antlers seem
to be maintaining a high standard.
</p>
<p>
In summer, the photographing of moose in the rivers, lakes and ponds
of Maine and New Brunswick amounts to an industry. I am uneasy about
the constant picking off of the largest and best breeding bulls of
the Mirimachi country, lest it finally reduce the size and antlers
of the moose of that region; but only the future can tell us just
how that prospect stands to-day.
</p>
<p>
In Alaska, our ever thoughtful and forehanded Biological Survey of
the Department of Agriculture has by legal proclamation at one
stroke converted the whole of the Kenai Peninsula into a magnificent
moose preserve. This will save <i> Alces gigas</i>, the giant moose
of Alaska, from extermination; and New Brunswick and the Minnesota
preserve will save <i> Alces americanus</i>. But in the northwest,
we can positively depend upon it that eventually, wherever the moose
may legally be hunted and killed by any Tom, Dick or Harry who can
afford a twenty-dollar rifle and a license, the moose surely will
disappear.
</p>
<p>
The moose laws of Alaska are strict&mdash;toward sportsmen, only!
The miners, "prospectors" and Indians may kill as many as they
please, "for food purposes." This opens the door to a great amount
of unfair slaughter. Any coffee-cooler can put a pan and pick into
his hunting outfit, go out after moose, and call himself a
"prospector."
</p>
<p>
I grant that the <i> real </i> prospector, who is looking for ores
and minerals with an intelligent eye, and knows what he is doing,
should have special privileges on game, to keep him from starving.
The settled miner, however, is in a different class. No miner should
ask the privilege of living on wild game, any more than should the
farmer, the steamboat man, the railway laborer, or the soldier in an
army post. The Indian should have no game advantages whatever over a
white man. He does not own the game of a region, any more than he
owns its minerals or its water-power. He should obey the general
game laws, just the same as white men. In Africa, as far as
possible, the white population wisely prohibits the natives from
owning or using firearms, and a good idea it is, too. I am glad
there is one continent on which the "I'm-just-as-good-as-you-are"
nightmare does not curse the whole land.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Musk-Ox. </span> &mdash;Now that the north pole has been safely discovered, and the south pole has become the storm-center of polar exploration, the harried musk-ox herds of the farthest north are having a rest. I think that most American sportsmen have learned that as a sporting proposition there is about as much fun and glory in harrying a musk-ox herd with dogs, and picking off the members of it at "parade rest," as there is in shooting range cattle in a round-up. The habits of the animal positively <a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page177] </span> </a> eliminate the real essence of sport,&mdash;difficulty and danger. When a musk-ox band is chased by dogs, or by wolves, the full-grown members of it, bulls and cows alike, instantly form a close circle around the calves, facing outward shoulder to shoulder, and stand at bay. Without the aid of a gunner and a rifle, such a formation is invincible! Mr. Paul Rainey's moving pictures tell a wonderful story of animal intelligence, bravery and devotion to the parental instinct.
</p>
<p>
For some reason, the musk-ox herds do not seem to have perceptibly
increased since man first encountered them. The number alive to-day
appears to be no greater than it was fifty years ago; and this leads
to the conclusion that the present delicate balance could easily be
disturbed the wrong way. Fortunately, it seems reasonably certain
that the Indians of the Canadian Barren Grounds, the Eskimo of the
far north, and the stray explorers all live outside the haunts of
the species, and come in touch only with the edge of the musk-ox
population as a whole. This leads us to hope and believe that,
through the difficulties involved in reaching them, the main bodies
of musk-ox of both species are safe from extermination.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the time has come for Canada, the United States
and Denmark to join in formulating a stiff law for the prevention of
wholesale slaughter of musk-ox for sport. It should be rendered
impossible for another sportsman to kill twenty-three head in one
day, as once occurred. Give the sportsman a bag of three bulls, and
no more. To this, no true sportsman will object, and the objections
of game-hogs only serve to confirm the justice of the thing they
oppose.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Grizzly Bear. </span> &mdash;To many persons it may seem strange that anyone should feel disposed to accord protection to such fierce predatory animals as grizzly bears, lions and tigers. But the spirit of fair play springs eternal in some human breasts. The sportsmen of the world do not stick at using long-range, high-power repeating rifles on big game, but they draw the line this side of traps, poisons and extermination. The sportsmen of India once thought,&mdash;for about a year and a day,&mdash;that it was permissible to kill troublesome and expensive tigers by poison. Mr. G.P. Sanderson tried it, and when his strychnine operations promptly developed three bloated and disgusting tiger carcasses, even his native followers revolted at the principle. That was the alpha and omega of Sanderson's poisoning activities.
</p>
<p>
I am quite sure that if the extermination of the tiger from the
whole of India were possible, and the to-be or not-to-be were put to
a vote of the sportsmen of India, the answer would be a thundering
<i> "No!" </i> Says Major J. Stevenson-Hamilton in his "Animal Life
in Africa:" "It is impossible to contemplate the use against the
lion of any other weapon than the rifle."
</p>
<p>
The real sportsmen and naturalists of America are decidedly opposed
to the extermination of the grizzly bear. They feel that the wilds
of North America are wide enough for the accommodation of many
grizzlies, without crowding the proletariat. A Rocky Mountain
without a grizzly upon it, or <a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page178] </span> </a> at least a bear of
some kind, is only half a mountain,&mdash;commonplace and tame. Put
one two-year-old grizzly cub upon it, and presto! every cubic yard
of its local atmosphere reeks with romantic uncertainty and fearsome
thrills.
</p>
<p>
A few persons have done considerable talking and writing about the
damage to stock inflicted by bears, but I think there is little
justification for such charges. Certainly, there is not one-tenth
enough real damage done by bears to justify their extermination. At
the present time, we hear that the farmers (!) of Kadiak Island,
Alaska, are being seriously harassed and damaged by the big Kadiak
bear,&mdash;an animal so rare and shy that it is very difficult for
a sportsman to kill one! I think the charges against the
bears,&mdash;if the Kadiak Islanders ever really have made
any,&mdash;need to be proven, by the production of real evidence.
</p>
<p>
In the United States, outside of our game preserves, I know of not
one locality in which grizzly bears are sufficiently numerous to
justify a sportsman in going out to hunt them. The California
grizzly, once represented by "Monarch" in Golden Gate Park, is
almost, if not wholly, extinct. In Montana, outside of Glacier Park
it is useless to apply for wild grizzlies. In the Bitter Root
Mountains and Clearwater Mountains of Idaho, there are grizzlies,
but they hide so effectually under the snow-bent willows on the
"slides" that it is almost impossible to get a shot. Northwestern
Wyoming still contains a few grizzlies, but there are so many square
miles of mountains around each animal it is now almost useless to go
hunting for them. British Columbia, western Alberta and the coast
mountains at least as far as Skaguay, and Yukon Territory generally,
all contain grizzlies, and the sportsman who goes out for sheep,
caribou and moose is reasonably certain to see half a dozen bears
and kill at least one or two. In those countries, the grizzly
species will hold forth long after all killable grizzlies have
vanished from the United States.
</p>
<p>
I think that it is now time for California, Montana, Washington,
Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming to give grizzly bears protection of some
sort. Possibly the situation in those states calls for a five-year
close season. Even British Columbia should now place a bag limit on
this species. This has seemed clear to me ever since two of my
friends killed (in the spring of 1912) <i> six </i> grizzlies in one
week! But Provincial Game Warden A. Bryan Williams says that at
present it would be impossible to impose a bag limit of one per year
on the grizzlies of British Columbia; and Mr. Williams is a sincere
game-protector.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Brown Bears Of Alaska. </span> &mdash;These magnificent monsters present a perplexing problem, which I am inclined to believe can be satisfactorily solved by the Biological Survey only in short periods, say of three or four years each. Naturally, the skin hunters of Alaska ardently desire the skins of those bears, for the money they represent. That side of the bear problem does not in the least appeal to the ninety odd millions of people who live this side of Alaska. The skins of the Alaskan brown bears have little value save as curiosities, nailed upon the wall, where they can not be stepped upon and injured. The <i> hunting </i> of those bears, however, is a business for men; and it is partly for that reason they <a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page179] </span> </a> should be preserved. A bear-hunt on the Alaska Peninsula, Admiralty or Montagu Islands, is an event of a lifetime, and with a bag limit of <i> one </i> brown bear, the species would be quite safe from extermination.

In Alaska there is some dissatisfaction over the protection accorded
the big brown bears; but those rules are right <i> as far as they
go</i>! A governor of Alaska once said to me: "The preservation of
the game of Alaska should be left to the <i> people </i> of Alaska.
It is their game; and they will preserve it all right!"
</p>
<p>
The answer? <i> Not by a long shot</i>!
</p>
<p>
Only three things were wrong with the ex-governor's view:
</p>
<p>
1.&mdash;The game of Alaska does <i> not </i> belong to the people
who live in Alaska&mdash;with the intent to get out to-morrow! It
belongs to the 93,000,000 people of the Nation.
</p>
<p>
2.&mdash;The preservation of the Alaskan fauna on the public domain
should not be left unreservedly to the people of Alaska, because
</p>
<p>
3.&mdash;As sure as shooting, they will <i> not </i> preserve it!
</p>
<p>
Congress is right in appropriating $15,000 for game protection in
Alaska. It is very necessary that the regulations for conserving the
wild life should be fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture, with the
advice of the Biological Survey.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Black Bear </span> is an interesting citizen. He harms nobody nor anything; he affords good sport; he objects to being exterminated, and wherever in <a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page180] </span> </a> North America he is threatened with extermination, he should at once be given protection! A black bear <i> in the wilds </i> is harmless. In captivity, posed as a household "pet," he is decidedly dangerous, and had best be given the middle of the road. In big forests he is a grand stayer, and will not be exterminated from the fauna of the United States until Washington is wrecked by anarchists.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The American Bison. </span> &mdash;I regard the American bison species as now reasonably secure against extermination. This is due to the fact that it breeds persistently and successfully in captivity, and to the great efforts that have been put forth by the United States Government, the Canadian Government, the American Bison Society, the New York Zoological Society, and several private individuals.

The species reached its lowest ebb in 1889, when there were only 256

Of wild bison there are only three groups: 49 head in the
Yellowstone National Park, about 75 Pablo "outlaws" around the
Montana Bison Range, and between 300 and 400 head in northern
Athabasca, southwest of Fort Resolution, existing in small and
widely scattered bands.
</p>
<p>
The efforts of man to atone for the great bison slaughter by
preserving the species from extinction have been crowned with
success. Two governments and two thousand individuals have shared
this task,&mdash;solely for sentimental reasons. In these facts we
find reason to hope and believe that other efforts now being made to
save other species from annihilation will be equally successful.

		THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF AFRICAN GAME

</div>
<p>
Thanks to the diligence with which sportsmen and field naturalists
have recorded their observations in the haunts of big game, it is
not at all difficult to forecast the immediate future of the big
game of the world. We may safely assume that all lands well suited
to agriculture, mining and grazing will become populated by
rifle-bearing men, with the usual result to the wild mammals and
birds. At the same time, the game of the open mountains everywhere
is thinly distributed and easily exterminated. On the other hand,
the unconquerable forest jungles of certain portions of the tropics
will hold their own, and shelter their four-footed inhabitants for
centuries to come.
</p>
<p>
On the open mountains of the world and on the grazing lands most big
game is now being killed much faster than it breeds. This is due to
the attacks of five times too many hunters, open seasons that are
too long, and bag limits that are far too liberal. As an example,
consider Africa Viewed in any way it may be taken, the bag limit in
British East Africa is appallingly high. Notice this astounding
array of wild creatures that <i> each hunter </i> may kill under a
license costing <i> only $250! </i>

The grand total is a possible 300 large hoofed and horned animals
representing <i> 44 species</i>! Add to this all the lions,
leopards, <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page182] </span> </a> cheetahs, cape hunting dogs and hyaenas that
the hunter can kill, and it will be enough to stock a zoological
garden!
</p>
<p>
Quite a number of these species, like the sable antelope, kudu,
Hunter's antelope, bongo and sitatunga are already rare, and
therefore they are all the more eagerly sought.
</p>
<p>
Into the fine grass-lands of British East Africa, suitable for crops
and stock grazing, settlers are steadily going. Each one is armed,
and at once becomes a killer of big game. And all the time the
visiting sportsmen are increasing in number, going farther from the
Uganda Railway, and persistently seeking out the rarest and finest
of the game. The buffalo has recovered from the slaughter by
rinderpest only in time to meet the onset of oversea sportsmen.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Arthur Jordan has seen much of the big game of British East
Africa, and its killing. Him I asked to tell me how long, in his
opinion, the big game of that territory will last outside of the
game preserves, as it is now being killed. He said, "Oh, it will
last a long time. I think it will last fifteen years!"
</p>
<p>
<i> Fifteen years! </i> And this for the richest big-game fauna of
any one spot in the whole world, which Nature has been <i> several
million years in developing and placing there</i>!
</p>
<p>
At present the marvelous herds of big game of British East Africa
and Uganda constitute the grandest zoological spectacle that the
world ever has seen in historic times. For such an area, the number
of species is incredible, and until they are seen, the thronging
masses of individuals are beyond conception. It is easy to say "a
herd of 3,000 zebras;" but no mere words can give an adequate
impression of the actual army of stripes and bars, and hoofs
thundering in review over a grassy plain.
</p>
<p>
But the settlers say, "The zebras must go! They break through our
best wire fences, ruin our crops, despoil us of the fruits of long
and toilsome efforts, and much expenditure. We simply can not live
in a country inhabited by herds of wild zebras." And really, their
contention is well founded. When it is necessary to choose between
wild animals and peaceful agriculture for millions of men, the
animals must give way.
</p>
<p>
In those portions of the great East African plateau region that are
suited to modern agriculture, stretching from Buluwayo to northern
Uganda, the wild herds are doomed to be crowded out by the farmer
and the fruit-grower. This is the inevitable result of civilization
and progress in wild lands. Marauding battalions of zebras,
bellicose rhinoceroses and murderous buffaloes do not fit in with
ranches and crops, and children going to school. Except in the great
game preserves, the swamps and the dense jungles it is certain that
the big game of the whole of eastern Africa is foredoomed to
disappear,&mdash;the largest and most valuable species first.
</p>
<p>
Five hundred years from now, when North America is worn out, and
wasted to a skeleton of what it now is, the great plateau region of
East Africa <a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page183] </span> </a> between Cape Town and Lake Rudolph will be a
mighty empire, teeming with white population. Giraffes and
rhinoceroses now are trampling over the sites of the cities and
universities of the future. Then the herds of grand game that now
make Africa a sportsman's wonderland will exist only in closed
territory, in books, and in memory.

<p>
From what has befallen in South Africa, we can easily and correctly
forecast the future of the big game of British East Africa and
Uganda. Less than fifty years ago, Cape Colony, Natal, Zululand, and
every <a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page184] </span> </a> country up to the Zambesi was teeming with
herds of big wild animals, just as the northern provinces now are.
As late as 1890, when Rhodesia was taken over by the Chartered
Company, and the capital city of Salisbury was staked out, an
American boy in the Pioneer Corps, now Honorable William Harvey
Brown, of Salisbury, wrote thus of the Gwibi Flats, near Salisbury:
</p>
<p>
"That evening I beheld on those flats a sight which probably will
never again be seen there to the end of the world. The variety
deploying before me was almost incredible! There, within the range
of my vision were groups of roan, sable and tsessebi antelopes,
Burchell zebras, [now totally extinct!] elands, reedbucks,
steinbucks and ostriches. It was like Africa in the days of
Livingstone. As I sat on my horse, viewing with amazement this
wonderful panorama of wild life, I was startled by a herd that came
galloping around a small hill just behind me."&mdash;("<i>On the
South African Frontier</i>," p. 114.)
</p>
<p>
That was in 1890. And how is it to-day?
</p>
<p>
Salisbury is a modern city, endorsed by two lines of railway. The
Gwibi Flats are farms. There is some big game yet, in Rhodesia south
of the Zambesi, but to find it you must go at least a week's journey
from the capital, to the remote corners that have not yet been
converted into farms or mining settlements. North of the Zambesi,
Rhodesia yet contains plenty of big game. The Victoria Falls station
is a popular starting point for hunting expeditions headed northeast
and northwest. In the northwest the game is yet quite in a state of
nature. Unfortunately the Barotse natives of that region can procure
from the Portuguese traders all the firearms and ammunition that
they can pay for, and by treaty they retain their hunting rights.
The final result will be&mdash;extermination of the game.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere throughout Rhodesia the natives are not permitted to have
guns and gunpowder,&mdash;a very wise regulation. In Alaska our
Indians are privileged to kill game all the year round, and they
have modern firearms with which to do it.
</p>
<p>
And how is it with the game of that day?
</p>
<p>
The true Burchell's zebra is now regarded as <i> extinct</i>! In
Cape Colony and Natal, that once teemed with big game in the
old-fashioned African way, they are <i> counting the individual wild
animals that remain</i>! Also, they are making game preserves,
literally everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Now that the best remaining game districts of Africa are rapidly
coming under British control, it is a satisfaction to observe that
the governing bodies and executive officers are alive to the
necessity of preserving the big game from actual extinction.
Excepting German East Africa, from Uganda to Cape Colony the game
preserves form an almost continuous chain. It is quite impossible to
enumerate all of them; but the two in British East Africa are of
enormous size, and are well stocked with game. South Africa contains
a great many smaller preserves and a few specimen herds of big game,
but that is about all. Except in a few localities the hunting of big
game in that region is done forever.
</p>
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page185] </span> </a>
<p>
The Western Districts Game and Trout Protective Association of South
Africa recently, (1911), has made careful counts and estimates of
the number of individual game animals remaining in Cape Colony, with
the following result:

<p class="centerheading">
	Big Game In The Cape Province
</p>
<p>
From information kindly placed at the disposal of the Association by
the Government, it was found that the following varieties of big
game are still found in the Province. The numbers, however, are only
approximate:
</p>
<p>
<i> Blesbok</i>: About 400 in Steynsburg, and 35 in Queen's Town
divisions.
</p>
<p>
<i> Bontebok</i>: About 30 in Bredasdorp and 45 in Swellendam
divisions.
</p>
<p>
<i> Buffalo</i>: About 340 in Uitenhage, 120 in Alexandria, and 75
in Bathurst divisions.
</p>
<p>
<i> Elephants</i>: About 130 in Alexandria, 160 in Uitenhage, 40 in
Bathurst, and 20 in Knysna divisions.
</p>
<p>
<i> Gemsbok</i>: About 2,450 in Namaqualand, 4,500 in Vryburg, 4,000
in Gordonia, and 670 in the Kenhardt, Mafeking and Barkly West
divisions.
</p>
<p>
<i> Koodoo</i>: About 10,000, found chiefly in the divisions of
Albany, Barkly West, Fort Beaufort, Hay, Herbert, Jansenville,
Kuruman, Ladismith, Mafeking, Mossel Bay, Oudtshoorn, Riversdale,
Steytlerville, Uitenhage, Victoria East and Vryburg.
</p>
<p>
<i> Oribi</i>: About 120, in the divisions of Albany and Alexandria.
</p>
<p>
<i> Rietbok</i>: About 170, in the Komgha division.
</p>
<p>
<i> Zebra</i>: About 560, most of which are to be found in the
divisions of Cradock, George and Oudtshoorn. A few are to be found
in the divisions of Uniondale and Uitenhage.
</p>
<p>
<i> Springbok</i>: Being migratory, it is difficult to estimate
their number. In some years they are compelled by drought to invade
the Province in large numbers. They are then seen as far south as
Calvinia and Fraserburg. Large numbers are, however, fenced in on
private estates in various parts of the Province.
</p>
<p>
<i> Klipspringers</i>: About 11,200, in the following divisions,
viz.: Namaqualand, 6,559; Kuruman, 2,100; Steytlerville, 1,530;
Oudtshoorn, 275; Hay, 250; Ladismith, 220; Graaff-Reinet, 119;
Kenhardt, 66; and Cradock, 56.
</p>
<p>
<i> Hartebeest</i>: About 9,700, principally in the divisions of
Vryburg, Gordonia, Kuruman, Mafeking, Kimberley, Hay and Beaufort
West.
</p>
<p>
<i> Wildebeest</i>: About 3,450 in Vryburg, 80 each in Gordonia and
Kuruman, 65 in Mafeking, 20 in Queen's Town, and a few in the
Bredasdorp divisions.
</p>
<p>
<i> Eland</i>: About 12 in the Graaff-Reinet division, privately
bred.
</p>
<p>
The above showing of the pitifully small numbers of the specimens
that constitute the remnant of the big-game of the Cape suggest just
one thing:&mdash;a universal close season throughout Cape Colony,
and no hunting whatever for ten years. And yet, what do we see?
</p>
<p>
The Report from which the above census was taken contains half a
column of solid matter, in small type, giving a list of the <i> open
seasons </i> all over Cape Colony, during which killing may be done!
So it seems that the spirit of slaughter is the same in Africa that
it is in America,&mdash;<i>kill</i>, as long as there is <i>
anything </i> alive to kill!
</p>
<p>
This list is of startling interest, because it shows how closely the
small remnants of big game are now marked down in South Africa.
</p>
<p>
In view of the success with which Englishmen protect their game when
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page186]
</span> </a> once they have made up their minds to do so, it is fair
to expect that the herds now under protection, as listed above, will
save their respective species from extinction. It is alarming,
however, to note the wide territory covered by the deadly "open
seasons," and to wonder when the bars really will be put up.
</p>
<p>
To-day, Mashonaland is a very-much-settled colony. The Cape to Cairo
railway and trains de luxe long ago attained the Palls of the
Zambesi, and now the Curator of the Salisbury Museum will have to
search diligently in far off Nyassaland, and beyond the Zambesi
River, to find enough specimens to fill his cases with
representatives of the vanished Rhodesian fauna. Once (1892) the
white rhinoceros was found in northern Rhodesia; but never again. In
Salisbury, elands and zebras are nearly as great a curiosity as they
are in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>
But for the discovery of white rhinoceroses in the Lado district, on
the western bank of the Nile below Gondokoro, we would now be saying
that <i> Rhinoceros simus </i> is within about ten specimens of
total extinction.
</p>
<p>
From South Africa, as far up as Salisbury, in central Rhodesia, at
least 99 per cent of the big game has disappeared before the white
man's rifle. Let him who doubts this scan the census of wild animals
still living in Cape Colony.
</p>
<p>
From all the other regions of Africa that are easily accessible to
gunners, the animal life is vigorously being shot out, and no man in
his senses will now say that the big game is breeding faster than it
is being killed. The reverse is painfully true. Mr. Carl Akeley, in
his quest for a really large male elephant for the American Museum
found and looked over <i> a thousand </i> males without finding one
that was really fine and typical. All the photographs of elephant
herds that were taken by Kermit Roosevelt and Akeley show a striking
absence of adult males and of females with long tusks. There are
only young males, and young females with small, short tusks. The
answer is&mdash;the white ivory hunters have killed nearly all the
elephants bearing good ivory.
</p>
<p>
The slaughter of big game is going on furiously in British East
Africa because the Uganda Railway opens up the entire territory to
hunters. Anyone, man or woman, who can raise $5,000 in cash can go
there and make a huge "bag" of big game. With a license costing only
$250 he can kill enough big game to sink a ship.
</p>
<p>
The bag limit in British East Africa is ruinously extravagant. If
the government desires the extermination of the game, such a bag
limit surely will promote that end. It is awful to think that for a
petty sum any man may buy the right to kill 300 <i> head </i> of
hoofed and horned animals, of 44 species, not counting the
carnivorous animals that also may be killed. That bag limit should
<i> immediately </i> be reduced <i> 75 per cent</i>!
</p>
<p>
As matters stand to-day in British East Africa, the big game of the
country, outside the three preserves, is absolutely certain to
disappear, in about one-fourth of the time that it took South Africa
to accomplish the same result. The reasons are
obvious:&mdash;superior accessibility, more deadly rifles, expert
professional guides, and a widespread craze for killing big game.
With care and economy, British <a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page187] </span> </a> East Africa should
furnish good hunting for two centuries, but as things are going on
to-day, twenty years will see a tremendous change for the worse, and
a disappearance of game that will literally astonish the natives.
</p>
<p>
German East Africa and Uganda will not exterminate their quotas of
big game quite so soon. The absence of railways is a great factor in
game-existence. The Congo Free State contains game and sporting
possibilities&mdash;on the unexplored uplands <i> between the
rivers</i>,&mdash;that are as yet totally unknown to sportsmen at
large. We are accustomed to thinking of the whole basin of the Congo
as a vast, gloomy and impenetrable forest.
</p>
<p>
There is to-day in Africa a vast reserve supply of grand game. It
inhabits regions that are either unknown, or most difficult to
penetrate. As a species in point, consider the okapi. Only the
boldest and most persistent explorers ever have set foot in its
tangled and miasmatic haunts. It may be twenty years before a living
specimen can be brought out. The gorilla and the chimpanzee are so
well protected by the density of their jungles that they never can
be exterminated&mdash;until the natives are permitted to have all
the firearms that they desire! When that day arrives, it is
"good-night" to all the wild life that is large enough to eat or to
wear.
</p>
<p>
The quagga and the blaubok became <i> extinct </i> before the world
learned that their existence was threatened! The giant eland, the
sable antelope, the greater kudu, the bontebok, blessbok, the
mountain and Burchell zebras, all the giraffes save that of Nigeria,
the big waterbucks, the nyala, the sitatunga, the bongo, and the
gerenuk&mdash;all will go in the same way, everywhere outside the
game preserves. The buffalo, zebra and rhinoceros are especially
marked for destruction, as annoyances to colonists. You who read of
the killing of these species to-day will read of their total
disappearance to-morrow. So long as the hunting of them is
permitted, their ultimate disappearance is fixed and certain. It is
not the way of rifle-shooting English colonists to permit herds of
big game to run about merely to be looked at.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the open plains of Africa, and the thin forests of the
plateau regions, will be the first to lose their big game. In the
gloomy fastnesses of the great equatorial forests, and other really
dense forests wherever found, the elephants, the Derby eland, the
bongo, the okapi, the buffaloes (of three species), the bush-pigs,
the bushbucks and the forest-loving antelopes generally will live,
for possibly one hundred years,&mdash;<i>or until the natives secure
plenty of modern firearms and ammunition</i>. Whenever and wherever
savages become supplied with rifles, then it is time to measure each
big-game animal for its coffin.
</p>
<p>
The elephants of the great equatorial forest westward of the lake
region will survive long after the last eastern elephant has bitten
the dust. The pygmy elephant of the lower Congo region (<i>Elephas
pumilio</i>) will be the last African elephant species to
disappear&mdash;because it inhabits dense miasmatic jungles, its
tusks are of the smallest size, and it has the least commercial
value.

	<div class="subtitle">
		THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THE GAME OF ASIA
	</div>
</div>
<p>
After a successful survival of man's influence through two thousand
years, at last the big game of India has made a good start on the
road to vanishment. Up to 1870 it had held its own with a tenacity
that was astonishing. In 1877, I found the Ganges&mdash;Jumna dooab,
the Animallai Hills, the Wynaad Forest and Ceylon literally teeming
with herds of game. The Animallais in particular were a hunter's
paradise. In each day of hunting, large game of some kind was a
certainty. The Nilgiri Hills had been quite well shot out, but in
view of the very small area and open, golf-links character of the
whole top of that wonderful sky plateau, that was no cause for
wonderment.
</p>
<p>
In those days no native shikaree owned and operated a gun,&mdash;or
at the most very, very few of them did. If a rogue elephant, a
man-eating tiger or a nasty leopard became a public nuisance, it was
a case for a sahib to come and doctor it with a .577 double-barreled
express rifle, worth $150 or more; and the sahibs had shooting
galore.
</p>
<p>
I think that no such great wild-life sights as those of the plateau
regions of Africa ever were seen in southern Asia. Conditions there
are different, and usually the game is widely scattered. The sambar
deer and muntjac of the dense forests, the axis of the bamboo
glades, the thameng deer of the Burmese jungles, the sladang, or
gaur, of the awful Malay tangle, and the big cats and canines will
last long and well. The ibexes, markhors, tahr and all the wild
sheep eventually will be shot out by sportsmen who are "sheep
crazy." The sheep and goats of Asia will disappear soon after the
plains animals of Africa, because no big game that lives in the open
can much longer endure the modern, inexpensive long-range rifles of
deadly accuracy and limitless repetition of fire.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I fear that by some unlucky turn of Fortune's wheel all
the native hunters of Asia will obtain rifles; and when they do, we
soon will see the end of the big game.
</p>
<p>
Even to-day we find that the primitive conditions of 1877 have been
greatly changed. In the first place, about every native shikaree
(hunter) owns a rifle, at a cost of about $25; and many other
natives possess guns, and assume to hunt with them. The logical
conclusion of this is more hunting and less game. The development of
the country has reduced the cover for game. New roads and railways
have made the game districts easily accessible, and real sportsmen
are now three or four times as numerous as they were in 1877.
</p>
<p>
At Toonacadavoo, in the Animallai Hills where thirty-five years ago
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page189]
</span> </a> there modestly nestled on the ridge beside the river
only Forest Ranger Theobold's bungalow, built of mud and covered
with grass thatch and bamboo rats, there is now a regular hill
station lighted by electricity, a modern sanatorium high up on the
bluff, a <i> club</i>, golf links, and other modern improvements. In
my day there were exactly four guns on the Animallais. Now there are
probably one hundred; and it is easy to guess how much big game
remains on the Delectable Mountains in comparison with the golden
days of 1877. I should say that there is now only one game animal
for every twenty-five that were there in my day.
</p>
<p>
I am told that it is like that all over India. Beyond question, the
gun-sellers and gun-users have been busy there, as everywhere else.
The game of India is on the toboggan slide, and the old days of
abundance have gone forever.
</p>
<p>
The first fact that strikes us in the face is the impending fate of
the great Indian rhinoceros, an animal as wonderful as the
Titanothere or the Megatherium. It is like a gift handed down to us
straight out of the Pleistocene age, a million years back. The
British paleontologists to-day marvel at <i> Elephas ganesa</i>, and
by great labor dig his bones out of the Sewalik rocks, but what one
of them all has yet made a move to save <i> Rhinoceros indicus </i>
from the quick extermination that soon will be his portion unless he
is accorded perpetual and real protection from the assaults of man?
</p>
<p>
Let the mammalogists of the world face this fact. The available
cover of the Indian rhinoceros is <i> alarmingly </i> decreasing,
throughout Assam and Bengal where the behemoth of the jungle has a
right to live. It is believed that the few remaining rhinos are
being shot much faster then they are breeding; and what will be the
effect of this upon an animal that requires fourteen years to reach
full maturity? To-day, the most wonderful hoofed mammal of all Asia
is booked for extermination, and unless very radical measures for
its preservation are at once carried into effect, it is probable
that twenty years more will see the last Indian rhino go down to
rise no more. One remedy would be a good, ample rhinoceros preserve;
and another, the most absolute and permanent protection for the
species, all along the line. Half-way measures will not suffice. It
is time to ring in a general alarm.
</p>
<p>
During the past eighteen years, only three specimens of that species
have come out of India for the zoological gardens and parks of the
world, and I think there are only five in captivity, all told.
</p>
<p>
We are told that in India now the natives are permitted to have
about all the firearms they can pay for. Naturally, in a country
containing over 300,000,000 people this is a deadly thing. Of course
there are shooting regulations, many of them; but their enforcement
is so imperfect that it is said that the natives are attacking the
big game on all sides, with deadly effect. I fear it is utterly
impossible for the Indian government to put enough wardens into the
field to watch the doings of the grand army of native poachers.
</p>
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page190] </span> </a>
<p>
Fortunately, the Indian native,&mdash;unlike the western
frontiersman,&mdash;does not contend that <i> he owns </i> the big
game, or that "all men are born free and equal." At the same time,
he means to have his full share of it, to eat, and to sell in
various forms for cash. Even in India, the sale-of-game dragon has
reared its head, and is to-day in need of being scotched with an
iron hand.
</p>
<p>
When I received direct from a friend in the native state of Kashmir
a long printed circular setting forth the hunting laws and
game-protective measures of that very interesting principality, it
gave me a shock. It was disquieting to be thus assured that the big
game of Kashmir has disappeared to such an extent that strong
protective measures are necessary. It was as if the Chief Eskimo of
Etah had issued a strong proclamation for the saving of the musk-ox.
</p>
<p>
In Kashmir, the destruction of game has become so serious that a
Game Preservation Department has been created, with the official
staff that such an organization requires. The game laws are printed
annually, and any variations from them may be made only by the
authority of the Maharajah himself. Up to date, <i> eight </i> game
preserves have been created, having a total area of about thee
hundred square miles. In addition to these, there are twelve small
preserves, each having an area of from twenty-five to fifty square
miles. By their locations, these seem to provide for all the species
of big game that are found in Kashmir,&mdash;the ibex, two forms of
markhor, the tahr. Himalayan bighorn sheep, burrhel and goral.
</p>
<p>
In our country we have several states that are very large, very
diversified in surface, and still inhabited by large game. Has any
one of those states created a series of game preserves even half way
comparable with those of Kashmir? I think not. Montana has made a
beginning with two preserves,&mdash;Snow Creek and the Pryor
Mountains,&mdash;but beside the splendid series of Kashmir they are
not worthy of serious mention.
</p>
<p>
And then following closely in the wake of that document came a
lengthy article in the "Proceedings of the Zoological Society of
London," by E.C. Stebbing, in which a correspondent of the Indian
<i> Field </i> clearly sets forth the fact that the big game of the
Himalayas now is menaced by a peril new to our consideration, but of
a most deadly character. Hear him:
</p>
<p>
"In this inventory (of game destroyers in India), the Gurkha soldier
does not find a place, for he belongs to a class which he amply
fills by himself with his small but very important personality. He
deserves separate notice. From the banks of the Sarda on the
frontier of Nepal, to the banks of the Indus, the battalions of
these gallant little men are scattered in cantonments all along the
outer spurs of the Himalayan range. In seven or eight of these
locations there are at least 14,000 of these disciplined warriors,
who, in the absence of opportunities for spilling human blood
legitimately, are given a free hand for slaughtering wild animals,
along five-hundred miles of the best hunting grounds of Upper
India."
</p>
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page191] </span> </a>
<p>
Now, since those facts must be true as reported, do they not in
themselves constitute a severe arraignment of the Indian government?
Why should that state of game slaughter endure, when a single
executive order to the C.O. of each post would effectually stop it?
</p>
<p>
In the making of game preserves, or "sanctuaries" as they are called
out there, the Government of India has shown rare and commendable
diligence. The total number is too great for enumeration here. The
native state of Mysore has seven, and the Nilgiri Hills have
sanctuaries aggregating about 100,000 acres in area. In the Wynaad
Forest, my old hunting-grounds at Mudumallay have been closed to
bison shooting, because of the alarming decrease of bison (gaur)
through shooting and disease. The Kundah Forest Reserve has been
made a partial game preserve, but the door might as well have been
left wide open as so widely ajar.
</p>
<p>
In eastern Bengal and Assam, several game preserves have been
created. On the whole, by the diligence and thoroughness with which
sanctuaries, as they are termed, have been created quite generally
throughout India, it is quite evident that the government and the
sportsmen of India have become thoroughly alarmed by the great
decrease of the game, and the danger of the extermination of
species. In the past India has been the finest and best-stocked
hunting-ground of all Asia, quite beyond compare, and the
destruction of her once-splendid fauna of big game would be a
zoological calamity.
</p>
<p>
<i> Tibet</i>.&mdash;As yet, Tibet offers free hunting, without
legal let or hindrance, to every sportsman who can climb up to her
lofty, wind-swept and whizzing-cold plateau. The man who hunts the
<i> Ovis poli</i>, superb creature though it be, pays in full for
his trophies. The ibex of the south help out the compensatory
damages, but even with that, the list of species available in
southern Tibet is painfully small. The Mitchell takin can be reached
from China, via Chungking, after a long, hard journey, over Consul
Mason Mitchell's trail; but the takin is about the only large hoofed
game available.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Altai Mountains</i>, of western China, contain the
magnificent Siberian argali, the grandfather of all sheep species,
whose horns must be seen to be believed. Through a quest for that
species the Russian military authorities played upon Mr. George L.
Harrison and his comrade a very grim and unsportsmanlike joke. At
the frontier military post, on the Russo-Chinese border, the two
Americans were courteously halted, hospitably entertained, and <i>
prevented </i> from going into the argali-infested mountains that
loomed up before them only a few miles away! The Russian officers
said:
</p>
<p>
"Sheep? Why, if you really want sheep, we will send out some of our
brave soldiers to shoot some for you; but there is no need for <i>
you </i> to take the trouble to go after them!"
</p>
<p>
After Mr. Harrison and his comrade had spent $5,000, and traveled
half way around the world for those sheep, that is in brief the
story of how <a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page192] </span> </a> the cup of Tantalus was
given them by the Russians, actually <i> at their goal</i>! As
spoil-sports, those Russian officers were the champions of the
world.
</p>
<p>
Seven hundred miles southeastward of the Altai Mountains of western
China, guarded by the dangerous hostility of savage native tribes,
there exists and awaits the scientific explorer, according to
report, an undiscovered wild horse. The Bicolored Wild Horse is
black and white, and joy awaits the zoologist or sportsman who sees
it first. Evidently it will not soon be exterminated by modern
rifles.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Impenetrable Forests</i>.&mdash;Although the mountains of
central Asia will in time be cleared of their big game,&mdash;when
by hook and by crook the natives secure plenty of modern
firearms,&mdash;there are places in the Far East that we know will
contain big game forever and a day. Take the Malay Peninsula, Borneo
and Sumatra as examples.
</p>
<p>
Mr. C. William Beebe, who recently has visited the Far East, has
described how the state of Selangor, between Malacca and Penang, has
taken on many airs of improvement since 1878, and sections of
Sarawak Territory are being cut down and burned for the growing of
rubber. Despite this I am trying to think that those developments
menace the total volume of the wild life of those regions but
little. I wonder if those tangled, illimitable, ever-renewing
jungles yet know that their faces have been scratched. White men
never will exterminate the big game of the really dense jungles of
the eastern tropics; but with enough axes, snares, guns and
cartridges <i> the natives </i> may be able to accomplish it!
</p>
<p>
In Malayana there are some jungles so dense, so tangled with lianas
and so thorny with Livistonias and rattan that nothing larger than a
cat can make way through them. There are thousands of square miles
so boggy, so swampy, so dark, gloomy and mosquito-ridden that all
men fear them and avoid them, and in them rubber culture must be
impossible. In those silent places the gaur, the rhino, the Malay
sambar, the clouded leopard and the orang-utan surely are measurably
safe from the game-bags and market gunners of the shooting world. It
is good to think that there is an equatorial belt of jungle clear
around the world, in Central and South America as well as in the old
World, in which there will be little extermination in our day,
except of birds for the feather market. But the open plains, open
mountains, and open forests of Asia and Australasia are in different
case. Eventually they will be "shot out."
</p>
<p>
China, all save Yunnan and western Mongolia, is now horribly barren
of wild life. Can it ever be brought back? We think it can not. The
millions of population are too many; and except in the great forest
tracts, the spread of modern firearms will make an end of the game.
Already the pheasants are being swept out of China for the London
market, and extinction is staring several species in the face. On
the whole, the pheasants of the Old World are being hit hard by the
rubber-planting craze. Mr. Beebe declares that owing to the inrush
of aggressive capital, the haunts of many species of pheasants are
being denuded of all their natural cover, and some mountain species
that are limited to small areas are practically certain to be
exterminated at an early date.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Destruction Of Animals For Fur. </span> &mdash;In the far North, only the interior of Kamchatka seems to be safe from the iron heel of the skin-hunter. A glance at the list of furs sold in London last year reveals one or two things that are disquieting. The total catch of furs for the year 1911 is enormous,&mdash;considering the great scarcity of wild life on two continents. Incidentally it must be remembered that every trapper carries a gun, and in studying the fur list one needs no help in trying to imagine the havoc wrought with firearms on the edible wild life of the regions that contributed all that fur. I have been told by trappers that as a class, trappers are great killers of game.
</p>
<p>
In order that the reader may know by means of definite figures the
extent to which the world is being raked and combed for fur-bearing
animals, we append below a statement copied from the <i> Fur News
Magazine </i> for November, 1912, of the sales of the largest London
fur house during the past two years.
</p>
<p>
With varying emotions we call attention to the wombat of Australia,
3,841; grebe, 51,261, and house cat, 92,407. Very nearly all the
totals of Lampson &amp; Co. for each species are much lower for the
sales of 1912 than for those of 1911. Is this fact significant of a
steady decline?

</div>
<p>
In <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII"> chapter XIII</a>, treating of the
"Extermination of Birds for Women's Hats," Dr. Hornaday has dealt
fully with the feather and plumage traffic after it enters the
brokers' hands, and has proved conclusively that the plumes of
egrets are gathered from the freshly killed birds. We may trace the
course of the plumes and feathers backward through the
tightly-packed bales and boxes in the holds of the vessels to the
ports of the savage lands whence they were shipped; then to the
skilful, dark hands of Mexican peon, Venezuelan Indian, African
negro or Asiatic Chinaman or Malay, who stripped the skin from the
flesh; and finally to the jungle or mountain side or terai where the
bird gave up its life to blowpipe, cross-bow, blunderbuss or
carefully set snare.
</p>
<p>
In various trips to Mexico, Venezuela and other countries in the
tropics of the New World I have seen many such scenes, but not until
I had completed a seventeen months' expedition in search of
pheasants, through some twenty wild countries of Asia and the East
Indies, did I realize the havoc which is being wrought week by week
everywhere on the globe. While we were absent even these few months
from the great centers of civilization, tremendous advances had been
made in air-ships and the thousand and one other modern phases of
human development, but evolution in the world of Nature as we
observed it was only destructive&mdash;a world-wide
katabolism&mdash;a retrogression often discernible from month to
month. We could scarcely repeat the trip and make the same
observations upon pheasants, so rapidly is this group of birds
approaching extinction.
</p>
<p>
The causes of this destruction of wild life are many and diverse,
and resemble one another only in that they all emanate from mankind.
To the casual traveller the shooting and trapping of birds for
millinery purposes at first seems to hold an insignificant place
among the causes. But this is only because in many of the larger
ports, the protective laws are more or less operative and the
occupation of the plume hunter <a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page196] </span> </a> is carried on in
secret ways. But it is as far-reaching and insidious as any; and
when we add to the actual number of birds slain, the compound
interest of eggs grown cold, of young birds perishing slowly from
hunger, of the thousands upon thousands of birds which fall wounded
or dead among the thick tropical jungle foliage and are lost, the
total is one of ghastly proportions.
</p>
<p>
Not to weaken my argument with too many general statements, let me
take at once some concrete cases. First, that of the Himalayan
pheasants and game-birds. In a recent interesting article by E.P.
Stebbing <a name="FNanchorH" id="FNanchorH"> </a> <a
class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_H"> [H] </a> the past,
present and hoped-for future of game birds and animals in India is
reviewed. Unfortunately, however, most of the finest creatures in
Asia live beyond the border of the British sphere of influence, and
though within sight, are absolutely beyond reach of civilized law.
The heart of the Himalayas,&mdash;the haunts of some of the most
beautiful birds in the world, the tragopans, the blood and impeyan
pheasants&mdash;lies within the limits of Nepal, a little country
which time and time again has bade defiance to British attacks, and
still maintains its independence. From its northern border Mt.
Everest looks down from its most exalted of all earthly summits and
sees valley after valley depleted of first one bird and then
another. I have seen and lived with Nepalese shepherds who have
nothing to do month after month but watch their flocks. In the lofty
solitudes time hangs heavy on their hands, and with true oriental
patience they weave loop after loop of yak-hair snares, and then set
them, not in dozens or scores, but in hundreds and thousands up and
down the valleys.
</p>
<p>
In one locality seven great valleys had been completely cleared of
pheasants, only a single pair of tragopans remaining; and from one
of these little brown men I took two hundred nooses which had been
prepared for these lone survivors. In these cases, the birds were
either cooked and eaten at once, or sold to some passing shepherd or
lama for a few annas. But in other parts of this unknown land
systematic collecting of skins goes on, for bale after bale of
impeyan and red argus (tragopan) pheasant skins goes down to the
Calcutta wharves, where its infamous contents, though known, are
safe from seizure under the Nepal Raja's seal! Thus it is that the
London feather sales still list these among the most splendid of all
living birds. And shame upon shame, when we read of 80 impeyan skins
"dull," or "slightly defective," we know that these are female
birds. Then, if ever, we realize that the time of the bird and the
beast is passing, the acme of evolution for these wonderful beings
is reached, and at most we can preserve only a small fragment of
them.

To the millinery hunter, what the egret is to America, and the bird
of paradise to New Guinea, the impeyan pheasant is to
India&mdash;the most coveted of all plumages. There is a great
tendency to blame the native hunter for the decrease of this and
other pheasants, and from what I have personally seen in many parts
of the Himalayas there is no question <a name="Page_197"
id="Page_197"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page197] </span> </a> that
the Garwhalese and Nepalese hill-men have wrought havoc among the
birds. But these men are by no means the sole cause. As long ago as
1879 we read that "The great demand for the brilliant skins of the
moonal that has existed for many years has led to their almost total
extermination in some parts of the hills, as the native shikaris
shoot and snare for the pot as well as for skins, and kill as many
females as males. On the other hand, though for nearly thirty years
my friend Mr. Wilson has yearly sent home from 1,000 to 1,500 skins
of this species and the tragopan, there are still in the woods
whence they were obtained as many as, if not more than, when he
first entered them, simply because he has rigidly preserved females
and nests, and (as amongst English pheasants) one cock suffices for
several hens."
</p>
<p>
Ignoring the uncertainty of the last statement, it is rather absurd
to think of a single man "preserving" females and nests in the
Himalayas from 1850 to 1880, when the British Government, despite
most efficient laws and worthy efforts is unable to protect the
birds of these wild regions to-day. The statement that after thirty
to forty-five thousand cock impeyans were shot or snared, as many or
more than the original quota remained, could only emanate from the
mind of a professional feather-hunter, and Hume should not be blamed
for more than the mere repetition of such figures. Let it be said to
the credit of Wilson, the slaughterer of something near forty-five
thousand impeyans, that he was a careful observer of the birds'
habits, and has given us an excellent account, somewhat coloured by
natives, but on the whole, the best we have had in the past. But it
is not pleasant to read of his waiting until "twenty or thirty have
got up and alighted in the surrounding trees, and have then walked
up to the different trees and fired at those I wished to procure
without alarming the rest, only those very close to the one fired at
being disturbed at each report."
</p>
<p>
Hume's opinion that in 1879 there were scores of places where one
might secure from ten to eighteen birds in a day, is certainly not
true to-day. Indeed, as early as 1858 we read that "This splendid
bird, once so abundant on the Western Himalayas is now far from
being so, in consequence of the numbers killed by sportsmen on
account of its beauty. Whole tracts of mountain forest once
frequented by the moonal are now <a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page198] </span> </a> almost without a
single specimen." The same author goes on naively to tell the reader
that "Among the most pleasant reminiscences of bygone days is a
period of eleven days, spent by the author and a friend on the Choor
Mountain near Simia, when among other trophies were numbered
sixty-eight moonal pheasants, etc."

</p>
<p>
For some unaccountable reason there is, or was for many years, a
very prevalent idea that the enormous number of skins which have
poured into the London market were from birds bred in the vicinity
of Calcutta. When we remember the intense heat of that low-lying
city, and learn from the records of the Calcutta Zoological Garden
that impeyans and tragopans are even shorter-lived than in Europe,
the absurdity of the idea is apparent. In spite of numberless
inquiries throughout India, I failed to learn of a single captive
young bird ever hatched and reared even in the high, cool,
hill-stations. The commercial value of an impeyan skin has varied
from five dollars to twenty dollars, according to the number
received annually. In 1876 an estimate placed the monthly average of
impeyans received in London at from two to eight hundred.
</p>
<p>
In such a case as Nepal, direct protective laws are of no avail. All
humane arguments are useless, but if the markets at the other end
<i> can be closed</i>, the slaughter will cease instantly and
automatically.

	A Long Series set Across a Valley, by the Kachins of the Burma-Chinese Border. A Wholesale Method of Wild-life Slaughter, Photographed by C. William Beebe, 1910
</p>
<p>
As a contrast to the millinery hunter of fifty years ago it is
refreshing to find that at last sincere efforts are being made in
British possessions to stop this traffic. I happened to be at
Rangoon when six large bales of pheasant skins were seized by the
Custom officials. A Chinaman had brought them from Yunnan via Bhamo,
and was preparing to ship them as ducks' feathers. Two of the bales
were opened for my inspection. The first contained about five
hundred Lady Amherst pheasant skins, falling to pieces and lacking
heads and legs. The second held over four hundred silver pheasants,
in almost perfect condition. The chief collector had put the
absolutely prohibitive fine of 200 on them, and was waiting for the
expiration of the legal number of days before burning the entire
lot. They must have represented years of work in decimating the
pheasant fauna of western China.
</p>
<p>
Far up in the wilderness of northern Burma, and over the Yunnan
border, we often came upon some of the most ingenious examples of
native trapping, a system which we found repeated in the Malay
States, Borneo, China and other parts of the Far East. A low bamboo
fence is built directly across a steep valley or series of valleys,
about half way from the summit to the lower end, and about every
fifteen feet a narrow opening is left, over which a heavy log is
suspended. Any creature attempting to make its way through, treads
upon several small sticks and <a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page200] </span> </a> by so doing springs
the trap and the dead-fall claims a victim. When a country is
systematically strung with traps such as these, sooner or later all
but a pitiful remnant of the smaller mammals, birds and reptiles are
certain to be wiped out. Morning after morning I have visited such a
runway and found dead along its path, what must have been all the
walking, running or crawling creatures which the night before had
sought the water at the bottom; pheasants, cobras, mouse-deer,
rodents, civets, and members of many other groups. In some countries
nooses instead of dead-falls guard the openings, but the result is
equally deadly.
</p>
<p>
I have described this method of trapping because of its future
importance in the destruction of wild life in the Far East. The
Chinaman in all his many millions is undergoing a remarkably swift
and radical evolution both of character and dress. In many ways, if
only from the viewpoint of the patient, thrifty store-keeper he is a
most powerful factor in the East, and is becoming more so. In many
cases he imitates the white nations by cutting off his queue and
altering his dress. In some mysterious correlated way his diet seems
simultaneously affected, and while for untold generations rice and
fish has satisfied all his gastronomic desires, a new craving, that
for meat, has come to him. The result is apparent in many parts of
the East. The Chinaman is willing and able to pay for meat, and the
native finds a new market for the creatures about him. Again and
again when I wished a few specimens of some certain pheasant I had
but to hail passing canoes and bid a few annas or "cash" or
"ringits" higher than the prospective Chinese purchaser would give,
and the pheasants were mine.
</p>
<p>
In the catalogues of the brokers' sales of feathers we read of many
thousands of the wonderful ocellated wing feathers of the argus
pheasant, but no less horrible is the sight of a canoe crammed with
the bedraggled bodies of these magnificent birds on their way to
some Chinese hamlet where they will be sold for a pittance, the
flesh eaten to the last tendon and the feathers given to the
children and puppies to play with. The newly-aroused appetite of the
Mongolian will soon be an important factor in the extermination of
animals and birds, few species being exempt, for the Chinaman lives
up to his reputation and is not squeamish as to the nature of his
meat.
</p>
<p>
Before we leave the subject of Chinamen let us consider another
recent factor in the destruction of wild life which is at present
widely operative in China itself. This is the cold storage
warehouse, of which six or eight enormous ones have gone up in
different parts of the East. To speak in detail only of the one at
Hankow, six hundred miles up the Yangtze, we found it to be the
largest structure in the city. Surrounded by a high wall, with each
entrance and exit guarded by armed Sikhs, it seemed like the feudal
castle of some medieval baron. Why such secrecy is necessary I could
not learn, as there are no laws against its business. But so
carefully guarded is its premises that until a short time ago even
the British consul-general of Hankow had not been allowed to enter.
He, however, at last refused to sign the papers for any more <a
name="Page_201" id="Page_201"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page201]
</span> </a> outgoing shipments until he should be allowed to see
what was going on within the warehouse. I hoped to be able to look
over some of the frozen pheasants for interesting scientific
material, but of course was not allowed to do so.
</p>
<p>
Although here in the heart of China, outside changes are not felt so
strongly and the newly-acquired meat diet of the border and emigrant
Chinese is hardly apparent, these warehouses have opened up a new
source of revenue, which has met with instant response. Thousands
and tens of thousands of wild shot or trapped pheasants and other
birds are now brought to these establishments by the natives from
far and near. The birds are frozen, and twice a year shipped on
specially refrigerated P. and O. steamships to England and the
continent of Europe where they seem to find a ready sale. Pigs and
chickens also figure in the shipments. Now the pheasants have for
centuries existed in enormous numbers in the endless ricefields of
China, without doing any damage to the crops. In fact they could not
be present in such numbers without being an important factor in
keeping down insect and other enemies of the grain. When their
numbers are decimated as they are being at present, there must
eventually result a serious upsetting of the balance of nature. Let
us hope that in some way this may be avoided, and that the present
famine deaths of thirty thousand or more in some provinces will not
be increased many fold.
</p>
<p>
When I started on this search for pheasants I was repeatedly told by
old explorers in the east that my task would be very different from
theirs of thirty years ago; that I would find steamers, railroads
and automobiles where formerly were only canoes and jungle. I indeed
found this as reported, but while my task was different it was made
no easier. Formerly, to be sure, one had from the start to paddle
slowly or push along the trails made by natives or game animals. But
then the wild life was encountered at once, while I found it always
far from the end of the steamer's route or the railroad's terminal,
and still to be reached only by the most primitive modes of travel.
</p>
<p>
I cite this to give point to my next great cause of destruction; the
burning and clearing of vast stretches of country for the planting
of rubber trees. The East seems rubber mad, and whether the enormous
output which will result from the millions of trees set out month
after month will be profitable, I cannot say. I can think only of
the vanishing of the <i> entire fauna </i> and <i> flora </i> of
many districts which I have seen as a direct result of this
commercial activity. One leaves Port Swettenham on the west coast of
Selangor, and for the hour's run to Kuala Lumpur sees hardly
anything but vast radiating lines of spindling rubber trees, all
underbrush cleared, all native growths vanished. From Kuala Lumpur
to Kuala Kubu at the very foot of the mountain backbone of the Malay
Peninsula, the same holds true. And where some area appears not
under cultivation, the climbing fern and a coarse, useless "lalang"
grass covers every inch of ground. One can hardly imagine a more
complete <a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page202] </span> </a> blotting out of the native fauna and flora
of any one limited region. And ever-extending roads for the
increasing motor cars are widening the cleared zone, mile after mile
to the north and south.
</p>
<p>
In this region, as we pushed on over the mountains into the
wilderness of Pahang, we saw little of the actual destruction of the
primeval native growth, but elsewhere it became a common sight.
Once, for many days we studied the wonderful life of a jungle which
stretched up to our very camp. Troops of rollicking wa-was or
gibbons frequented the forest; squirrels, tupaias, birds and insects
in myriads were everywhere during the day. Great fruit-bats, flying
lemurs, owls and other nocturnal creatures made the evenings and
nights full of interest.
</p>
<p>
And then, one day without warning came the sound of an ax, and
another and another. From that moment the songs, cries, chirps and
roars of the jungle were seldom heard from our camp. Every day saw
new phalanxes of splendid primeval trees fallen, or half suspended
in their rigging of lianas. The leaves withered, the flower petals
fell and we heard no more the crackling of bamboos in the wind. Then
the pitiful survivors of the destruction were brought to us; now a
baby flying lemur, flung from its hole by the falling of some tree;
young tupaias, nestling birds; a few out of the thousands of
creatures from insects to mammals which were slain so that a
Chinaman or Malay might eke a few dollars, four or five years hence,
from a grove of rubber trees. I do not say it is wrong. Man has won
out, and might is right, as since the dawn of creation; but to the
onlooker, to the lover of nature and the animal world it is a
terrible, a hopeless thing.
</p>
<p>
One cannot at present leave the tourist line of travel in the East
without at once encountering evidence of the wholesale direct
slaughter of wild life, or its no less certain extermination by the
elimination of the haunts and the food plants of the various beasts
and birds.

	<div class="subtitle">
		THE SAVAGE VIEW-POINT OF THE GUNNER
	</div>
</div>
<p>
The mental attitude of the men who shoot constitutes a deadly factor
in the destruction of wild life and the extermination of species.
Fully ninety-five per cent of the sportsmen, gunners and other men
and boys who kill game, all over the world and in all nations,
regard game birds and mammals only as things to be killed <i> and
eaten</i>, and not as creatures worth preserving for their beauty or
their interest to mankind. This is precisely the viewpoint of the
cave-man and the savage, and it has come down from the
Man-with-a-Club to the Man-with-a-Gun absolutely unchanged save for
one thing: the latter sometimes is prompted to save to-day in order
to slaughter to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
The above statement of an existing fact may seem harsh; and some
persons may be startled by it; but it is based on an acquaintance
with thousands of men who shoot all kinds of game, all over the
world. My critics surely will admit that my opportunities to meet
the sportsmen and gunners of the world are, and for thirty-five
years have been, rather favorable. As a matter of fact, I think the
efforts of the hunters of my personal acquaintance have covered
about seven-tenths of the hunting grounds of the world. If the
estimate that I have formed of the average hunter's viewpoint is
wrong, or even partially so, I will be glad to have it proven in
order that I may reform my judgment and apologize.
</p>
<p>
In working with large bodies of bird-shooting sportsmen I have
steadily&mdash;and also painfully&mdash;been impressed by their
intentness on. killing, and by the fact that <i> they seek to
preserve game only to kill it! </i> Who ever saw a bird-shooter rise
in a convention and advocate the preservation of any species of game
bird on account of its beauty or its esthetic interest <i> alive?
</i> I never did; and I have sat in many conventions of sportsmen.
All the talk is of open seasons, bag limits and killing rights. The
man who has the hardihood to stand up and propose a five-year close
season has "a hard row to hoe." Men rise and say: "It's all
nonsense! There's plenty of quail shooting on Long Island yet."
</p>
<p>
Throughout the length and breadth of America, the ruling passion is
to kill as long as anything killable remains. The man who will
openly advocate the stopping of quail-shooting because the quails
are of such great value to the farmers, or because they are so <i>
beautiful </i> and companionable to man, receives no sympathy from
ninety per cent of the bird-killing sportsmen. The remaining ten per
cent think seriously about the matter, and favor long close seasons.
It is my impression that of the men who shoot, it is only among the
big-game hunters that we find <a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page204] </span> </a> much genuine
admiration for game animals, or any feeling remotely resembling
regard for it.
</p>
<p>
The moment that a majority of American gunners concede the fact that
game birds are worth preserving for their beauty, and their value as
living neighbors to man, from that moment there is hope for the
saving of the Remnant. That will indeed be the beginning of a new
era, of a millennium in fact, in the preservation of wild life. It
will then be easy to enact laws for ten-year close seasons on whole
groups of species. Think what it would mean for such a close season
to be enacted for all the grouse of the United States, all the
shore-birds of the United States, or the wild turkey wherever found!
</p>
<p>
To-day, the great&mdash;indeed, the <i> only</i>&mdash;opponents of
long close seasons on game birds are the gunners. Whenever and
wherever you introduce a bill to provide such a season, you will
find that this is true. The gun clubs and the Downtrodden Hunters'
and Anglers' Protective Associations will be quick to go after their
representatives, and oppose the bill. And state senators and
assemblymen will think very hard and with strong courage before they
deliberately resolve to do their duty regardless of the opposition
of "a large body of sportsmen,"&mdash;men who have votes, and who
know how to take revenge on lawmakers who deprive them of their
"right" to kill. The greatest speech ever made in the Mexican
Congress was uttered by the member who solemnly said: "I rise to
sacrifice ambition to honor!"
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the men who shoot have become possessed of the idea
that they have certain inherent, God-given "rights" to kill game!
Now, as a matter of fact, a sportsman with a one-hundred-dollar Fox
gun in his hands, a two-hundred-dollar dog at his heels and five
one-hundred-dollar bills in his pocket has no more "right" to kill a
covey of quail on Long Island than my milkman has to elect that it
shall be let alone for the pleasure of his children! The time has
come when the people who don't shoot must do one of two things:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		They must demonstrate the fact that they have rights in the wild creatures, and demand their recognition, or
	</li>
	<li>
		See the killable game all swept off the continent by the Army of Destruction.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
Really, it is to me very strange that gunners never care to save
game birds on account of their beauty. One living bob white on a
fence is better than a score in a bloody game-bag. A live squirrel
in a tree is poetry in motion; but on the table a squirrel is a
rodent that tastes as a rat smells. Beside the ocean a flock of
sandpipers is needed to complete the beautiful picture; but on the
table a sandpiper is beneath contempt. A live deer trotting over a
green meadow, waving a triangular white flag, is a sight to thrill
any human ganglion; but a deer lying dead, &mdash;unless it has an
exceptionally fine head,&mdash;is only so much butcher's meat.
</p>
<p>
One of the finest sights I ever saw in Montana was a big flock of
sage grouse slowly stalking over a grassy flat thinly sprinkled with
sage-brush. It was far more inspiring than any pile of dead birds
that I ever saw. I remember scores of beautiful game birds that I
have seen and not killed; but of all the game birds that I have
eaten or tried to eat in New York, I remember with sincere pleasure
only <i> one</i>. Some of the ancient cold-storage candidates I
remember "for cause," as the lawyers say.

<p>
Sportsmen and gunners, for God's sake elevate your viewpoint of the
game of the world. Get out of the groove in which man has run ever
since the days of Adam! There is something in a game bird over and
above its pound of flesh. You don't "need" the meat any longer; for
you don't know what hunger is, save by reading of it. Try the
field-glass and the camera, instead of the everlasting gun. Any fool
can take a five-dollar gun and kill a bird; but it takes a genius to
photograph one wild bird and get "a good one." As hunters, the
camera men have the best of it. One good live-bird photograph is
more of a trophy and a triumph than a bushel of dead birds. The
birds and mammals now are literally dying for <i> your </i> help in
the making of long close seasons, and in the real stoppage of
slaughter. Can you not hear the call of the wild remnant?
</p>
<p>
It is time for the people who don't shoot to call a halt on those
who do; "and if this be treason, then let my enemies make the most
of it!"
</p>
<p>
Since the above was written, I have read in the <i> Outdoor World
</i> for April, 1912, the views of a veteran sportsman and writer,
Mr. Emerson Hough, on the wild-life situation as it seems to him
to-day. It is a strong utterance, even though it reaches a
pessimistic and gloomy conclusion which I do not share. Altogether,
however, its breadth of view, its general accuracy, and its
incisiveness, entitle it to a full hearing. The following is only an
extract from a lengthy article entitled, "God's Acre:"
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<blockquote>
	<p class="centerheading">
		EMERSON HOUGH'S VIEW OF THE SITUATION
	</p>
	<p>
The truth is none the less the truth because it is unpleasant to
face. There is no well posted sportsman in America, no manufacturer
of sporting goods in America, no man well versed in American outdoor
matters, who does not know that we are at the evening of the day of
open sport in America. Our old ways have failed, all of them have
failed. The declining fortunes of the best sportsman's journals of
America would prove that, if proof were asked. Our sportsmanship has
failed. Our game laws have failed, and we know they have failed. Our
game is almost gone, and we know it is almost gone. America has
changed and we know that it has changed, although we have not
changed with it. The old America is done and it is gone, and we know
that to be the truth. The old order passeth, and we know that the
new order must come soon if it is to work any salvation for our wild
game and our life in the open in pursuit of it.
	</p>
	<p>
There are many reasons for this fact, these facts. Perhaps the
greatest lies in the steady advance of civilization into the
wilderness, the usurpation for agricultural or industrial use of
many of the ancient breeding and feeding places of the wild game.
All over the West and now all over Canada, the plow advances, that
one engine which cannot be gainsaid, which never turns a backward
furrow.
	</p>
	<p>
Another great agency is the rapid perfection of transportation all
over the world. Take the late influx of East African literature. If
there really were not access to that country we would not have this
literature, would not have so many pictures from that country. And
if even Africa will soon be overrun, if even Africa soon will be
shot out, what hope is there for the game of the wholly accessible
North American continent?
	</p>
	<p>
It is all too easy now for the slaughterer to get to his work, all
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page207]
</span> </a> too easy for him to transport the fruits of the
slaughter. At the hands of the ignorant, the unscrupulous and the
unsparing, our game has steadily disappeared until it is almost
gone. We have handled it in a wholly greedy, unscrupulous and
selfish fashion. This has been our policy as a nation. If there is
to be success for any plan to remedy this, it must come from a few
large-minded men, able to think and plan, and able to do more than
that&mdash;to follow their plans with deeds.
	</p>
	<p>
I have seen the whole story of modern American sportsmanship, so
called. It has been class legislation and organized
selfishness&mdash;that is what it has been, and nothing else. I do
not blame country legislators, game dealers, farmers, for calling
the sportsmen of America selfish and thoughtless. I do not blame
them for saying that the so-called protective measures advanced by
sportsmen have been selfish measures, and looking to destruction
rather than to protection. At least that has been their actual
result. I have no more reverence for a sportsman than for anyone
else, and no reverence for him at all because he is or calls himself
a sportsman. He has got to be a man. He has got to be a citizen.
	</p>
	<p>
I have seen millions of acres of breeding and feeding grounds pass
under the drain and under the plow in my own time, so that the
passing whisper of the wild fowl's wing has been forgotten there now
for many years. I have seen a half dozen species of fine game birds
become extinct in my own time and lost forever to the American
people.
	</p>
	<p>
And you and I have seen one protective society after another,
languidly organized, paying in a languid dollar or so per capita
each year, and so swiftly passing, also to be forgotten. We have
seen one code and the other of conflicting and wholly selfish game
laws passed, and seen them mocked at and forgotten, seen them all
fail, as we all know.
	</p>
	<p>
We have seen even the nation's power&mdash;under that Ark of the
Covenant known as the Interstate Commerce Act&mdash;fail to stop
wholly the lessening of our wild game, so rapidly disappearing for
so many reasons.
	</p>
	<p>
We have seen both selfish and unselfish sportsmen's journals attempt
to solve this problem and fail to do so. Some of them were great and
broad-minded journals. Their record has not been one of disgrace,
although it has been one of defeat; for some of them really desired
success more than they desired dividends. These, all of them, bore
their share of a great experiment, an experiment in a new land,
under a new theory of government, a theory which says a man should
be able to restrain himself, and to govern himself. Only by
following their theory through to the end of that experiment could
they know that it was to fail in one of its most vitally interesting
and vitally important phases.
	</p>
	<p>
But now, as we know, all of these agencies, selfish or unselfish,
have failed to effect the salvation of American wild game. Not by
any scheme, device, or theory, not by any panacea can the old days
of America be brought back to us.

<p>
Mr. Hough's views are entitled to respectful consideration; but on
one vital point I do not follow him.
</p>
<p>
I believe most sincerely&mdash;in fact, <i> I know</i>,&mdash;that
it is <i> possible </i> to make a few new laws which, in addition to
the many, many good protective laws we already have, will bring back
the game, just as fast and as far as man's settlements, towns,
railroads, mines and schemes in general ever can permit it to come
back.
</p>
<p>
If the American People as a whole elect that our wild life shall be
saved, and to a reasonable extent brought back, then by the Eternal
it will be saved and brought back! The road lies straight before us,
and the going is easy&mdash;<i>if </i> the Mass makes up its mind to
act. But on one vital point Mr. Hough is right. The sportsman alone
never will save the game! The people who do not kill must act,
independently.

	"You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live."
</p>
<p>
"In no country in the world," says Mr. C.L. Marlatt, of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, "do insects impose a heavier tax on farm
products than in the United States." These attacks are based upon an
enormous and varied annual output of cereals and fruits, and a great
variety and number of trees. For every vegetable-eating insect,
native and foreign, we seem to have crops, trees and plant food
galore; and their ravages rob the market-basket and the dinner-pail.
In 1912 there were riots in the streets of New York over the high
cost of food.
</p>
<p>
In 1903, this state of fact was made the subject of a special
inquiry by the Department of Agriculture, and in the "Yearbook" for
1904, the reader will find, on page 461, an article entitled, "The
Annual Loss Occasioned by Destructive Insects in the United States."
The article is not of the sensational type, it was not written in an
alarmist spirit, but from beginning to end it is a calm,
cold-blooded analysis of existing facts, and the conclusions that
fairly may be drawn from them. The opinions of several experts have
been considered and quoted, and often their independent figures are
stated.
</p>
<p>
With the disappearance of our birds generally, and especially the
slaughter of song and other insect-eating birds both in the South
and North, the destruction of the national wealth by insects forges
to the front as a subject of vital importance. The logic of the
situation is so simple a child can see it. Short crops mean higher
prices. If ten per cent of our vegetable food supply is destroyed by
insects, as certain as fate we will feel it <i> in the increased
cost of living</i>.
</p>
<p>
I would like to place Mr. Marlatt's report in the hands of every
man, boy and school-teacher in America; but I have not at my
disposal the means to accomplish such a task. I cannot even print it
here in full, but the vital facts can be stated, briefly and in
plain figures.

<p class="centerheading">
	Crops And Insects.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Corn. </span> &mdash;The principal insect enemies of corn are the chinch bug, corn-root worm (<i>Diabrotica longicornis</i>), bill bug, wire worm, <a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page209] </span> </a> boll-worm or ear-worm, cut-worm, army worm, stalk worm, grasshopper, and plant lice, in all a total of about fifty important species! Several of these pests work secretly. At husking time the wretched ear-worm that ruins the terminal quarter or fifth of an immense number of ears, is painfully in evidence. The root-worms work insidiously, and the moles and shrews are supposed to attack them and destroy them. The corn-root worm is charged with causing an annual loss of two per cent of the corn crop, or $20,000,000; the chinch bug another two per cent; the boll or ear-worm two per cent more. The remaining insect pests are charged with two per cent, which makes eight per cent in all, or a total of $80,000,000 lost each year to the American farmer through the ravages of insects. This is not evenly distributed, but some areas suffer more than others.

<p class="captionheading">
	THE CUT-WORM, (<i>Peridroma Sancia</i>)
</p>
<p class="captionsubheading">
	Very Destructive to Crops
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Wheat. </span> &mdash;Of all our cereal crops, wheat is the one that suffers most from <a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page210] </span> </a> insects. There are three insects that cause to the wheat industry an annual loss of about ten per cent. The <i> chinch bug </i> is the worst, and it is charged with five per cent ($20,000,000) of the total loss. The <i> Hessian fly </i> comes next in order, and occasionally rolls up enormous losses. In the year 1900, that insect caused to Indiana and Ohio alone the loss of 2,577,000 <i> acres </i> of wheat, and the total cost to us of that insect in that year "undoubtedly approached $100,000,000." Did that affect the price of wheat or not? If not, then there is no such thing as a "law of supply and demand."
</p>
<p>
<i> Wheat plant-lice </i> form collectively the third insect pest
destructive to wheat, of which it is reported that "the annual loss
occasioned by wheat plant-lice probably does not fall short of two
or three per cent of the crop."
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Hay And Forage Crops. </span> &mdash;These are attacked by locusts, grasshoppers, army worms, cut-worms, web worms, small grass worms and leaf hoppers. Some of these pests are so small and work so insidiously that even the farmer is prone to overlook their existence. "A ten per cent shrinkage from these and other pests in grasses and forage plants is a minimum estimate."
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Cotton. </span> &mdash;The great enemies of the cotton-planter are the cotton boll weevil, the bollworm and the leaf worm; but other insects inflict serious damage. In 1904 the loss occasioned by the boll weevil, chiefly in Texas, was conservatively estimated by an expert, Mr. W.D. Hunter, at $20,000,000. The boll worm of the southwestern cotton states has sometimes caused an annual loss of $12,000,000, or four per cent of the crops in the states affected. Before the use of arsenical poisons, the leaf worm caused an annual loss of from twenty to thirty million dollars; but of late years that total has been greatly reduced.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Fruits. </span> &mdash;The insects that reduce our annual fruit crop attack every portion of the tree and its product. The woolly aphis attacks the roots of the fruit tree, the trunk and limbs are preyed upon by millions of scale insects and borers, the leaves are devastated by the all-devouring leaf worms, canker worms and tent caterpillars, while the fruit itself is attacked by the codling moth, curculio and apple maggot. To destroy fruit is to take money out of the farmer's pocket, and to attack and injure the tree is like undermining his house itself. By an annual expenditure of about $8,250,000 in cash for spraying apple trees, the destructiveness of the codling moth and curculio have been greatly reduced, but that money is itself a cash loss. Add to this the $12,000,000 of actual shrinkage in the apple crop, and the total annual loss to our apple-growers due to the codling moth and curculio is about $20,000,000. In the high price of apples, a part of this loss falls upon the consumer.
</p>
<p>
In 1889 Professor Forbes calculated that the annual loss to the
fruit-growers of Illinois from insect ravages was $2,375,000. In
1892, insects caused to Nebraska apple-growers a loss computed at
$2,000,000 and, in 1897, New York farmers lost $2,500,000 from that
cause. "In many sections of the Pacific Northwest the loss was from
fifty to seventy-five per cent." (Yearbook, page 470.)
</p>
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page211] </span> </a>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Forests. </span> &mdash;"The annual losses occasioned by insect pests to forests and forest products (in the United States) have been estimated by Dr. A.D. Hopkins, special agent in charge of forest insect investigations, at not less than $100,000,000. &hellip; It covers both the loss from insect damages to standing timber, and to the crude and manufactured forest products. The annual loss to growing timber is conservatively placed at $70,000,000."

There are other insect damages that we will not pause to enumerate
here. They relate to cattle, horses, sheep and stored grain products
of many kinds. Even cured tobacco has its pest, a minute insect
known as the cigarette beetle, now widespread in America and
"frequently the cause of very heavy losses."
</p>
<p>
The millions of the insect world are upon us. Their cost to us has
been summed up by Mr. Marlatt in the table that appears below.

The millions of the insect world are upon us. The birds fight them
for us, and when the birds are numerous and have nestlings to feed,
the number of insects they consume is enormous. They require
absolutely nothing at our hands save <i> the privilege of being let
alone while they work for us! </i> In fighting the insects, our only
allies in nature are the songbirds, woodpeckers, shore-birds,
swallows and martins, certain hawks, moles, shrews, bats, and a few
other living creatures. All these wage war at their own expense. The
farmers might just as well lose $8,250,000 through a short apple
crop as to pay out that sum in labor and materials in spraying
operations. And yet, fools that we are, we go on slaughtering our
friends, and allowing others to slaughter them, under the same brand
of fatuous folly that leads the people of Italy to build anew on the
smoking sides of Vesuvius, after a dozen generations have been swept
away by fire and ashes.
</p>
<p>
In the next chapter we will consider the work of our friends, The
Birds.

To-day, from Halifax to Los Angeles, and from Key West to Victoria,
a deadly contest is being waged. The fruit-growers, farmers, forest
owners and "park people" are engaged in a struggle with the insect
hordes for the possession of the trees, shrubs and crops. Go out
into the open, with your eyes open, and you will see it for
yourself. Millions of dollars are being expended in it. Look at this
exhibit of what is going on around me, at this very
moment,&mdash;July 19, 1912:
</p>
<p>
The bag insects, in thousands, are devouring the leaves of locust
and maple trees.
</p>
<p>
The elm beetles are trying to devour the elms; and spraying is in
progress.
</p>
<p>
The hickory-bark borers are slaughtering the hickories; and even
some park people are neglecting to take the measures necessary to
stop it!
</p>
<p>
The tent caterpillars are being burned.
</p>
<p>
The aphis (scale insects) are devouring the tops of the <i> white
potatoes </i> in the New York University school garden, just as the
potato beetle does.
</p>
<p>
The codling moth larvae are already at work on the apples.
</p>
<p>
The leaves affected by the witch hazel gall fly are being cut off
and burned.
</p>
<p>
These are merely the most conspicuous of the insect pests that I now
see daily. I am not counting those of second or third-rate
importance.
</p>
<p>
Some of these hordes are being fought with poisonous sprays, some
are being killed by hand, and some are being ignored.
</p>
<p>
In view of the known value of the remaining trees of our country,
each woodpecker in the United States is worth twenty dollars in
cash. Each nuthatch, creeper and chickadee is worth from five to ten
dollars, according to local circumstances. You might just as well
cut down four twenty-inch trees and let them lie and decay, as to
permit one woodpecker to be killed and eaten by an Italian in the
North, or a negro in the South. The downy woodpecker is the
relentless enemy of the codling moth, an insect that annually
inflicts upon our apple crop damages estimated by the experts of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture at twelve million dollars!
</p>
<p>
Now, is a federal strong-arm migratory bird law needed for such
birds or not? Let the owners of orchards and forests make answer.

	<span class="title"> The Case Of The Codling Moth And Curculio. </span> &mdash;The codling moth and curculio are twin terrors to apple-growers, partly because of their <a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page214] </span> </a> deadly destructiveness, and partly because man is so weak in resisting them. The annual cost of the fight made against them, in sprays and labor and apparatus, has been estimated at $8,250,000. And what do the birds do to the codling moth,&mdash;when there are any birds left alive to operate? The testimony comes from all over the United States, and it is worth while to cite it briefly as a fair sample of the work of the birds upon this particularly deadly pest. These facts and quotations are from the "Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture," for 1911.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Downy Woodpecker </i> is the champion tree-protector, and
also one of the greatest enemies of the codling moth. When man is
quite unable to find the hidden larvae, Downy locates it every time,
and digs it out. It extracts worms from young apples so skillfully
that often the fruit is not permanently injured. Mr. F.M. Webster
reports that the labors of this bird "afford actual and immediate
relief to the infected fruit." Testimony in favor of the downy
woodpecker has come from New York, New Jersey, Texas and California,
"and no fewer than twenty larvae have been taken from a single
stomach."
</p>
<p>
Take the <i> Red-Shafted Flicker </i> vs. the codling moth. Mr. A.P.
Martin of Petaluma, Cal., states that during the early spring months
(of 1890) they were seen by hundreds in his orchard, industriously
examining the trunks and larger limbs of the fruit trees; and he
also found great numbers of them around sheds where he stored his
winter apples and pears. As the result of several hours' search, Mr.
Martin found only one worm, and this one escaped only by accident,
for several of the birds had been within a quarter of an inch of it.
"So eager are woodpeckers in search, of codling moths that they have
often been known to riddle the shingle traps and paper bands which
are placed to attract the larvae about to spin cocoons."

In all, says Mr. W.L. McAtee, thirty-six species of birds of
thirteen families help man in his irrepressible conflict against his
deadly enemy, the codling moth. "In some places they destroy from
sixty-six to eighty-five per cent of the hibernating larvae."
</p>
<p>
Now, are the farmers of this country content to let the Italians of
the North, and the negroes of the South, shoot those birds for food,
and devour them? What is the great American farmer going to <i> do
</i> about this matter? What he should do is to write and urge his
members of Congress to work for and vote for the federal migratory
bird bill.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Cotton Boll Weevil. </span> &mdash;Let us take one other concrete case. The cotton boll weevil invaded the United States from Mexico in 1894. Ten years later it was costing the cotton planters an annual loss estimated at fifteen million dollars per year. Later on that loss was estimated at twenty million dollars. The cotton boll weevil strikes at the heart of the industry by destroying the boll of the cotton plant. While the total <a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page216] </span> </a> loss never can be definitely ascertained, we know that it has amounted to many millions of dollars. The figure given above has been widely quoted, and so far as I am aware, never disputed.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately we have at hand a government publication on this subject
which gives some pertinent facts regarding the bird enemies of the
cotton boll weevil. It is Circular No. 57 of the Biological Survey,
Department of Agriculture. Any one can obtain it by addressing that
Department. I quote the most important portions of this valuable
document:
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p class="centerheading">
	Birds Useful In The War Against The Cotton Boll Weevil.
</p>
<p class="centerflat">
	By H.W. Henshaw, Chief of the Biological Survey.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
The main purpose of this circular is to direct the attention of
cotton growers and others in the cotton growing states to the
importance of birds in the boll weevil war, to emphasize the need of
protection for them, and to suggest means to increase the numbers
and extend the range of certain of the more important kinds.
	</p>
	<p>
Investigations by the Biological Survey show that thirty-eight
species of birds eat boll weevils. While some eat them only
sparingly others eat them freely, and no fewer than forty-seven
adult weevils have been found in the stomach of a single cliff
swallow. Of the birds known at the present time to feed on the
weevil, among the most important are the orioles, nighthawks, and,
foremost of all, the swallows (including the purple martin).
	</p>
	<p class="list">
		<span class="title"> Orioles. </span> &mdash;Six kinds of orioles live in Texas, though but two inhabit the southern states generally. Orioles are among the few birds that evince a decided preference for weevils, and as they persistently hunt for the insects on the bolls, they fill a place occupied by no other birds. They are protected by law in nearly every state in the Union, but their bright plumage renders them among the most salable of birds for millinery purposes, and despite protective laws, considerable numbers are still killed for the hat trade. It is hardly necessary to point out that their importance as insect eaters everywhere demands their protection, but more especially in the cotton belt.

		<span class="title"> Nighthawk. </span> &mdash;The nighthawk, or bull-bat, also renders important service in the destruction of weevils, and catches them on the wing in considerable numbers, especially during its migration. Unfortunately, <i> the nighthawk is eaten for food in some sections of the South, and considerable numbers are shot for this purpose</i>. The bird's value for food, however, is infinitesimal as compared with the service it renders the cotton grower and other agriculturists, and every effort should be made to spread broadcast a knowledge of its usefulness as a weevil destroyer, with a view to its complete protection.
	</p>
	<p class="list">
		<span class="title"> Swallows. </span> &mdash;Of all the birds now known to destroy weevils, swallows are the most important. Six species occur in Texas and the southern states. <a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page217] </span> </a> The martin, the barn swallow, the bank swallow, the roughwing, and the cliff swallow breed locally in Texas, and all of them, except the cliff swallow, breed in the other cotton states. The white-bellied, or tree swallow, nests only in the North, and by far the greater number of cliff swallows nest in the North and West.
	</p>
	<p>
As showing how a colony of martins thrives when provided with
sufficient room to multiply, an experiment by Mr. J. Warren Jacobs,
of Waynesburg, Pa., may be cited. The first year five pairs were
induced to occupy the single box provided, and raised eleven young.
The fourth year three large boxes, divided into ninety-nine rooms,
contained fifty-three pairs, and they raised about 175 young. The
colony was thus nearly three hundred strong at the close of the
fourth season. The effect of this number of hungry martins on the
insects infesting the neighborhood may be imagined.
	</p>
	<p>
From the standpoint of the farmer and the cotton grower, swallows
are among the most useful birds. Especially designed by nature to
capture insects in midair, their powers of flight and endurance are
unexcelled, and in their own field they have no competitors. Their
peculiar value to the cotton grower consists in the fact that, like
the nighthawk, they capture boll weevils when flying over the
fields, which no other birds do. Flycatchers snap up the weevils
near trees and shrubbery. Wrens hunt them out when concealed under
bark or rubbish. Blackbirds catch them on the ground, as do the
killdeer, titlark, meadow lark, and others; while orioles hunt for
them on the bolls. But it is the peculiar function of swallows to
catch the weevils as they are making long flights, leaving the
cotton fields in search of hiding places in which to winter or
entering them to continue their work of devastation.
	</p>
	<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page218] </span> </a>
	<p>
Means have been taken to inform residents of the northern states of
the value of the swallow tribe to agriculturists generally, and
particularly to cotton planters, in the belief that the number of
swallows breeding in the North can be substantially increased. The
cooperation of the northern states is important, since birds bred in
the North migrate directly through the southern states in the fall
on their way to the distant tropics, and also in the spring on their
return.
	</p>
	<p>
Important as it is to increase the number of northern breeding
swallows, it is still more important to increase the number nesting
in the South and to induce the birds there to extend their range
over as much of the cotton area as possible. Nesting birds spend
much more time in the South than migrants, and during the weeks when
the old birds are feeding young they are almost incessantly engaged
in the pursuit of insects.
	</p>
	<p>
It is not, of course, claimed that birds alone can stay the ravages
of the cotton boll weevil in Texas, but they materially aid in
checking the advance of the pest into the other cotton states.
Important auxiliaries, in destroying these insects, birds aid in
reducing their numbers within safe limits, and once within safe
limits in keeping them there. Hence it is for the interests of the
cotton states that special efforts be made to protect and care for
the weevil-eating species, and to increase their numbers in every
way possible.&mdash;(End of the circular.)

Millions of Americans and near-Americans, both old and young, now

We cannot spray our forests; and if the wild birds do not protect,
them from insects, <i> nothing will</i>! If you will watch a warbler
collecting the <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page219] </span> </a> insects out of the top of a
seventy-foot forest oak, busy as a bee hour after hour, it will
convince you that the birds do for the forests that which man with
all his resources cannot accomplish. You will then realize that to
this country every woodpecker, chickadee, titmouse, creeper and
warbler is easily worth its weight in gold. The killing of any
member of those groups of birds should be punished by a fine of
twenty-five dollars.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Bob-White. </span> &mdash;And take the <i> Bob White Quail</i>, for example, and the weeds of the farm. To kill weeds costs money&mdash;hard cash that the farmer earns by toil. Does the farmer put forth strenuous efforts to protect the bird of all birds that does most to help him keep down the weeds? Far from it! All that the <i> average </i> farmer thinks about the quail is of killing it, for a few ounces of meat on the table.
</p>
<p>
It is fairly beyond question that of all birds that influence the
fortunes of the farmers and fruit-growers of North America, the
common quail, or bob white, is one of the most valuable. It stays on
the farm all the year round. When insects are most numerous and
busy, Bob White devotes to them his entire time. He cheerfully
fights them, from sixteen to eighteen hours per day. When the
insects are gone, he turns his attention to the weeds that are
striving to seed down the fields for another year. Occasionally he
gets a few grains of wheat that have been left on the ground by the
reapers; but he does <i> no damage</i>. In California, where the
valley quail once were very numerous, they sometimes consumed
altogether too much wheat for the good of the farmers; but outside
of California I believe such occurrences are unknown.
</p>
<p>
Let us glance over the bob white's bill of fare:
</p>
<p>
<i> Weed Seeds</i>.&mdash;One hundred and twenty-nine different
weeds have been found to contribute to the quail's bill of fare.
Crops and stomachs have been found crowded with rag-weed seeds, to
the number of one thousand, while others had eaten as many seeds of
crab-grass. A bird shot at Pine Brook, N.J., in October, 1902, had
eaten five thousand seeds of green fox-tail grass, and one killed on
Christmas Day at Kinsale, Va., had <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page220] </span> </a> taken about ten
thousand seeds of the pig-weed. (Elizabeth A. Reed.) In Bulletin No.
21, Biological Survey, it is calculated that if in Virginia and
North Carolina there are four bob whites to every square mile, and
each bird consumes one ounce of seed per day, the total destruction
to weed seeds from September 1st to April 30th in those states alone
will be 1,341 tons.
</p>
<p>
In 1910 Mrs. Margaret Morse Nice, of Clark University, Worcester,
Mass., finished and contributed to the Journal of Economic
Entomology (Vol. III., No. 3) a masterful investigation of "The Food
of the Bob-White." It should be in every library in this land. Mrs.
Nice publishes the entire list of 129 species of weed seeds consumed
by the quail,&mdash;and it looks like a rogue's gallery. Here is an
astounding record, which proves once more that truth is stranger
than fiction:

<i> A few sample meals of insects</i>.&mdash;The following are
records of single individual meals of the bob white:
</p>
<p>
Of grasshoppers, 84; chinch bugs, 100; squash bugs, 12; army worm,
12; cut-worm, 12; mosquitoes, 568 in three hours; cotton boll
weevil, 47; flies, 1,350; rose slugs, 1,286. Miscellaneous insects
consumed by a laying hen quail, 1,532, of which 1,000 were
grasshoppers; total weigh of the lot, 24.6 grams.
</p>
<p>
"F.M. Howard, of Beeville, Texas, wrote to the U.S. Bureau of
Entomology, that the bob whites shot in his vicinity had their crops
filled with the weevils. Another farmer reported his cotton fields
full of quail, and an entire absence of weevils." Texas and Georgia
papers (please copy.)
</p>
<p>
And yet, because of its few pitiful ounces of flesh, two million
gunners and ten thousand lawmakers think of the quail <i> only as a
bird that can be shot and eaten! </i> Throughout a great portion of
its former range, including New York and New Jersey, the species is
surely and certainly on the verge of <i> total extinction</i>. And
yet sportsmen gravely discuss the "bag limit," and "enforcement of
the bag-limit law" as a means of bringing back this almost vanished
species! Such folly in grown men is very trying.

<p>
<i> To my friend, the Epicure</i>:&mdash;The next time you regale a
good appetite with blue points, terrapin stew, filet of sole and
saddle of mutton, touched up here and there with the high lights of
rare old sherry, rich claret and dry monopole, pause as the dead
quail is laid before you, on a funeral pyre of toast, and consider
this: "Here lies the charred remains of the Farmer's Ally and
Friend, poor Bob White. In life he devoured 145 different kinds of
bad insects, and the seeds of 129 anathema weeds. For the smaller
pests of the farm, he was the most <a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page222] </span> </a> marvelous engine of
destruction that God ever put together of flesh and blood. He was
good, beautiful and true; and his small life was blameless. And here
he lies, dead; snatched away from his field of labor, and destroyed,
in order that I may be tempted to dine three minutes longer, after I
have already eaten to satiety."
</p>
<p>
Then go on, and finish Bob White.

	<span class="title"> The Case Of The Robin. </span> &mdash;For a long time this bird has been slaughtered in the South for food, regardless of the agricultural interests of the North. No Southern gentleman ever shoots robins, or song birds of any kind, but the negroes and poor whites do it. The worst case of recent occurrence was the slaughter in the town of Pittsboro, North Carolina.
</p>
<p>
It was in January, 1912. The Mayor of the town, Hon. Bennet Nooe,
was away from home; and during a heavy fall of snow "the robins came
into the town in great numbers to feed upon the berries of the cedar
trees. In order that the birds might be killed without restriction,
the Board of Aldermen suspended the ordinance against the firing of
guns in the town, and permitted the inhabitants to kill the robins."
</p>
<p>
A disgraceful carnival of slaughter immediately followed in which
"about all the male population" participated. Regarding this, Mayor
Nooe later on wrote to the editor of Bird Lore as follows:
</p>
<p>
"Hearing of this, on my return, I went to the Aldermen, <i> all of
whom were guilty</i>, and told them that they and all others who
were guilty would have to be fined. Three out of the five submitted
and paid up, but they insisted that the ordinance be changed to read
exactly as it is written here, with the exception that <i> all could
shoot </i> robins in the town until the first of March; whereupon I
resigned, as was stated."&mdash;(<i>Bird Lore, </i> XIV, 2. p. 140.)
</p>
<p>
The Mayor was quite right. The robin butchers of Pittsboro were not
worthy to be governed by him.

of an exhausting examination of 3,398 warbler stomachs, from
seventeen species of birds, and the result is: 94.99 per cent of

vegetable food. What more can any forester ask of a bird?

	<span class="title"> The Hawks And Owls. </span> &mdash;Let no other state repeat the error that once was made in Pennsylvania when that state enacted in 1885, her now famous hawk-and-owl bounty law. In order to accomplish the wholesale destruction of her birds of prey, a law was passed providing for the payment of a bounty of fifty cents each for the scalps of hawks and owls. Immediately the slaughter began. In two years 180,000 scalps were brought in, and $90,000 were paid out for them. It was estimated that the saving to the farmers in poultry amounted to one dollar for each $1,205 paid out in bounties.
</p>
<p>
The awakening came even more swiftly than the ornithologists
expected. <a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page224] </span> </a> By the end of two years from the passage of
"the hawk law," the farmers found their fields and orchards
thoroughly overrun by destructive rats, mice and insects, and they
appealed to the legislature for the quick repeal of the law. With
all possible haste this was brought about; but it was estimated by
competent judges that in damages to their crops the hawk law cost
the people of Pennsylvania nothing less than two million dollars.
</p>
<p>
Moral: Don't make any laws providing for the destruction of hawks
and owls until you have exact knowledge, and know in advance what
the results will be.
</p>
<p>
In the space at my disposal for this subject, it is impossible to
treat our species of hawks and owls separately. The reader can find
in the "American Natural History" fifteen pages of text, numerous
illustrations and many figures elucidating this subject.
Unfortunately Dr. Fisher's admirable work on "The Hawks and Owls"
has long been out of print, and unobtainable. There are, however, a
few observations that must be recorded here.
</p>
<p>
Each bird of prey is a balanced equation. Each one, I think without
a single exception, does <i> some </i> damage, chiefly in the
destruction of valuable wild birds. The value of the poultry
destroyed by hawks and owls is very small in comparison with their
killing of wild prey. <i> Many of the species do not touch domestic
poultry</i>! At the same time, when a hawk of any kind, or an owl,
sets to work deliberately and persistently to clean out a farmer's
poultry yard, and is actually doing it, that farmer is justified in
killing that bird. But, the <i> occasional </i> loss of a broiler is
not to be regarded as justification for a war of extermination on
<i> all </i> the hawks that fly! Individual wild-animal nuisances
can occasionally become so exasperating as to justify the use of the
gun,&mdash;when scarecrows fail; but in all such circumstances the
greatest judgment, and much forbearance also, is desirable and
necessary.
</p>
<p>
The value of hawks and owls rests upon their perpetual warfare on
the millions of destructive rats, mice, moles, shrews, weasels,
rabbits and English sparrows that constantly prey upon what the
farmer produces. On this point a few illustrations must be given.
One of the most famous comes via Dr. Fisher, from one of the towers

Neither of them should be destroyed,&mdash;not even though they do, once in a great while, take a chicken or wild bird. They pay for them, four times over, by rat-killing. Mr. J. Alden Loring states that he once knew a pair of red-shouldered hawks to nest within fifty rods of a poultry farm on which there were 800 young chickens and 400 ducks, not one of which was taken.

up fat pork, or large chunks of suet, on the south sides of
conspicuous trees, and encourage the woodpeckers, nuthatches,

		Our Vanishing Shorebirds
	</p>
	<p class="centerflat">
		By Prof. W.L. McAtee
	</p>
	<p>
The term shorebird is applied to a group of long-legged,
slender-billed, and usually plainly colored birds belonging to the
order Limicolae. More than sixty species of them occur in North
America. True to their name they frequent the shores of all bodies
of water, large and small, but many of them are equally at home on
plains and prairies.
	</p>
	<p>
Throughout the eastern United States shorebirds are fast vanishing.
While formerly numerous species swarmed along the Atlantic coast and
in the prairie regions, many of them have been so reduced that
extermination seems imminent. The black-bellied plover or
beetlehead, which occurred along the Atlantic seaboard in great
numbers years ago, is now seen only as a straggler. The golden
plover, once exceedingly abundant east of the Great Plains, is now
rare. Vast hordes of long-billed dowitchers formerly wintered in
Louisiana; now they occur only in infrequent flocks of a half dozen
or less. The Eskimo curlew within the last decade has probably been
exterminated and the other curlews greatly reduced. In fact, all the
larger species of shorebirds have suffered severely.
	</p>
	<p>
So adverse to shorebirds are present conditions that the wonder is
that any escape. In both fall and spring they are shot along the
whole route of their migration north and south. Their habit of
decoying readily and persistently, coming back in flocks to the
decoys again and again, in spite of murderous volleys, greatly
lessens their chances of escape.
	</p>
	<p>
The breeding grounds of some of the species in the United States and
Canada have become greatly restricted by the extension of
agriculture, and their winter ranges in South America have probably
been restricted in the same way.
	</p>
	<p>
Unfortunately, shorebirds lay fewer eggs than any of the other
species generally termed game birds. They deposit only three or four
eggs, and hatch only one brood yearly. Nor are they in any wise
immune from the great mortality known to prevail among the smaller
birds. Their eggs and young are constantly preyed upon during the
breeding season by crows, gulls, and jaegers, and the far northern
country to which so many of them resort to nest is subject to sudden
cold storms, which kill many of the young. In the more temperate
climate of the United States small birds, in general, do not bring
up more than one young bird for every two eggs laid. Sometimes the
proportion of loss is much greater, actual <a name="Page_229"
id="Page_229"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page229] </span> </a> count
revealing a destruction of 70 to 80 per cent of nests and eggs.
Shorebirds, with sets of three or four eggs, probably do not on the
average rear more than two young for each breeding pair.
	</p>
	<p>
It is not surprising, therefore, that birds of this family, with
their limited powers of reproduction, melt away under the relentless
warfare waged upon them. Until recent years shorebirds have had
almost no protection. Thus, the species most in need of stringent
protection have really had the least. No useful birds which lay only
three or four eggs should be retained on the list of game birds. The
shorebirds should be relieved from persecution, and if we desire to
save from extermination a majority of the species, action must be
prompt.
	</p>
	<p>
The protection of shorebirds need not be based solely on esthetic or
sentimental grounds, for few groups of birds more thoroughly deserve
protection from an economic standpoint. Shorebirds perform an
important service by their inroads upon mosquitoes, some of which
play so conspicuous a part in the dissemination of diseases. Thus,
nine species are known to feed upon mosquitoes, and hundreds of the
larvae or "wigglers" were found in several stomachs. Fifty-three per
cent of the food of twenty-eight northern phalaropes from one
locality consisted of mosquito larvae. The insects eaten include the
salt-marsh mosquito (<i>Aedes sollicitans</i>), for the suppression
of which the State of New Jersey has gone to great expense. The nine
species of shorebirds known to eat mosquitoes are:

Cattle and other live stock also are seriously molested by
mosquitoes as well as by another set of pests, the horse-flies.
Adults and larvae of these flies have been found in the stomachs of
the dowitcher, the pectoral sandpiper, the hudsonian godwit, and the
killdeer. Two species of shorebirds, the killdeer and upland plover,
still further befriend cattle by devouring the North American fever
tick.

Shorebirds are fond of other insect pests of forage and grain crops,
including the army worm, which is known to be eaten by the killdeer
and spotted sandpiper; also cutworms, among whose enemies are the
avocet, woodcock, pectoral and Baird sandpipers, upland plover, and
killdeer. Two caterpillar enemies of cotton, the cotton worm and the
cotton cutworm, are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer. The
latter bird feeds also on caterpillars of the genus <i>
Phlegethontius</i>, which includes, the tobacco and tomato worms.
	</p>
	<p>
The principal farm crops have many destructive beetle enemies also,
and some of these are eagerly eaten by shorebirds. The boll weevil
and clover-leaf weevil are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer,
the rice weevil by the killdeer, the cowpea weevil by the upland
plover, and the clover-root curculio by the following species of
shorebirds:

The last two eat also other weevils which attack cotton, grapes and
sugar beets. Bill-bugs, which often do considerable damage to corn,
seem to be favorite food of some of the shorebirds. They are eaten
by the Wilson phalarope, avocet, black-necked stilt, pectoral
sandpiper, killdeer, and upland plover. They are an important
element of the latter bird's diet, and no fewer than eight species
of them have been found in its food.
	</p>
	<p>
Wireworms and their adult forms, click beetles, are devoured by the
northern phalarope, woodcock, jacksnipe, pectoral sandpiper,
killdeer, and upland plover. The last three feed also on the
southern corn leaf-beetle and the last two upon the grapevine
colaspis. Other shorebirds that eat leaf-beetles are the Wilson
phalarope and dowitcher.
	</p>
	<p>
Crayfishes, which are a pest in rice and corn fields in the South
and which injure levees, are favorite food of the black-necked
stilt, and several other shorebirds feed upon them, notably the
jacksnipe, robin snipe, spotted sandpiper, upland plover, and
killdeer.
	</p>
	<p>
Thus it is evident that shorebirds render important aid by devouring
the enemies of farm crops and in other ways, and their services are
appreciated by those who have observed the birds in the field. Thus
W.A. Clark, of Corpus Christi, Tex., reports that upland plovers are
industrious in following the plow and in eating the grubs that
destroy garden stuff, corn, and cotton crops. H.W. Tinkham, of Fall
River, Mass., says of the spotted sandpiper: "Three pairs nested in
a young orchard behind my house and adjacent to my garden. I did not
see them once go to the shore for food (shore about 1,500 feet
away), but I did see them many times make faithful search of my
garden for cutworms, <a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page232] </span> </a> spotted squash bugs, and
green flies. Cutworms and cabbage worms were their special prey.
After the young could fly, they still kept at work in my garden, and
showed no inclination to go to the shore until about August 15th.
They and a flock of quails just over the wall helped me
wonderfully."
	</p>
	<p>
In the uncultivated parts of their range also, shorebirds search out
and destroy many creatures that are detrimental to man's interest.
Several species prey upon the predaceous diving beetles <i>
(Dytiscidae), </i> which are a nuisance in fish hatcheries and which
destroy many insects, the natural food of fishes. The birds now
known to take these beetles are:

Large numbers of marine worms of the genus <i> Nereis</i>, which
prey upon oysters, are eaten by shorebirds. These worms are common
on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and are eaten by shorebirds
wherever they occur. It is not uncommon to find that from 100 to 250
of them have been eaten at one meal. The birds known to feed upon

The economic record of the shorebirds deserves nothing but praise.
These birds injure no crop, but on the contrary feed upon many of
the worst enemies of agriculture. It is worth recalling that their
diet includes such pests as the Rocky Mountain locust and other
injurious grasshoppers, the army worm, cutworms, cabbage worms,
cotton worm, cotton cutworm, boll weevil, clover leaf weevil, clover
root curculio, rice weevil, corn bill-bugs, wireworms, corn
leaf-beetles, cucumber beetles, white grubs, and such foes of stock
as the Texas fever tick, horseflies, and mosquitoes. Their warfare
on crayfishes must not be overlooked, nor must we forget the more
personal debt of gratitude we owe them for preying upon mosquitoes.
They are the most important bird enemies of these pests known to us.
	</p>
	<p>
Shorebirds have been hunted until only a remnant of their once vast
numbers is left. Their limited powers of reproduction, coupled with
the natural vicissitudes of the breeding period, make their increase
slow, and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination.
	</p>
	<p>
In the way of protection a beginning has been made, and a continuous
close season until 1915 has been established for the following
birds: The killdeer, in Massachusetts and Louisiana; the upland
plover, in Massachusetts, and Vermont; and the piping plover in
Massachusetts. But, considering the needs and value of these birds,
this modicum of protection is small indeed.
	</p>
	<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page233] </span> </a>
	<p>
The above-named species are not the only ones that should be exempt
from persecution, for all the shorebirds of the United States are in
great need of better protection. They should be protected, first, to
save them from the danger of extermination, and, second, because of
their economic importance. So great, indeed, is their economic
value, that their retention on the game list and their destruction
by sportsmen is a serious loss to agriculture.&mdash;(End of the
circular.)

<p>
The following appeared in the <i> Zoological Society Bulletin</i>,
for January, 1909, from Richard Walter Tomalin, of Sydney, N.S.W.:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
"In the subdistricts of Robertson and Kangaloon in the Illawarra
district of New South Wales, what ten years ago was a waving mass of
English cocksfoot and rye grass, which had been put in gradually as
the dense vine scrub was felled and burnt off, is now a barren
desert, and nine families out of every ten which were renting
properties have been compelled to leave the district and take up
other lands. This is through the grubs having eaten out the grass by
the roots. Ploughing proved to be useless, as the grubs ate out the
grass just the same. Whilst there recently I was informed that it
took three years from the time the grubs were first seen until
to-day, to accomplish this complete devastation;. in other words,
three years ago the grubs began work in the beautiful country of
green mountains and running streams.
	</p>
	<p>
"The birds had all been ruthlessly shot and destroyed in that
district, and I was amazed at the absence of bird life. The two
sub-districts I have mentioned have an area of about thirty square
miles, and form a table-land about 1200 feet above sea level."
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The same kind of common sense that teaches men to go in when it
rains, and keep out of fiery furnaces, teaches us that as a business
proposition it is to man's interest to protect the birds. Make them
plentiful and keep them so. When we strike the birds, we hurt
ourselves. The protection of our insect-eating and seed-eating birds
is a cash proposition,&mdash;protect or pay.
</p>
<p>
Were I a farmer, no gun ever should be fired on my premises at any
bird save the English sparrow and the three bad hawks. Any man who
would kill my friend Bob White I would treat as an enemy. The man
who would shoot and eat any of the song-birds, woodpeckers, or
shorebirds that worked for me, I would surely molest.
</p>
<p>
<i> Every farmer should post every foot of his lands, cultivated and
not cultivated</i>. The farmer who does not do so is his own enemy;
and he needs a guardian.
</p>
<p>
At this stage of wild life extermination, it is impossible to make
our bird-protection laws too strict, or too far-reaching. The
remnant of our birds should be protected, with clubs and guns if
necessary. All our shore birds should be accorded a ten-year close
season. Don't ask the gunners whether they will <i> agree </i> to it
or not. <i> Of course they will not agree to it,&mdash;never</i>!
But our duty is clear,&mdash;to go ahead and <i> do it</i>!

		GAME AND AGRICULTURE; AND DEER AS A FOOD SUPPLY

<p>
As a state and county asset, the white-tailed deer contains
possibilities that as yet seem to be ignored by the American people
as a whole. It is quite time to consider that persistent, prolific
and toothsome animal.
</p>
<p>
The proposition that large herds of horned game can not becomingly
roam at will over farms and vineyards worth one hundred dollars per
acre, affords little room for argument. Generally speaking, there is
but one country in the world that breaks this well-nigh universal
rule; and that country is India. On the plains between and adjacent
to the Ganges and the Jumna, for two thousand years herds of
black-buck, or sasin antelope, have roamed over cultivated fields so
thickly garnished with human beings that to-day the rifle-shooting
sportsman stands in hourly peril of bagging a five-hundred-rupee
native every time he fires at an antelope.
</p>
<p>
Wherever rich agricultural lands exist, the big game must give
way,&mdash;<i>from those lands</i>. To-day the bison could not
survive in Iowa, eastern Nebraska or eastern Kansas, any longer than
a Shawnee Indian would last on the Bowery. It was foredoomed that
the elk, deer, bear and wild turkey should vanish from the rich
farming regions of the East and the middle West.
</p>
<p>
To-day in British East Africa lions are being hunted with dogs and
shot wholesale, because they are a pest to the settlers and to the
surviving herds of big game. At the same time, the settlers who are
striving to wrest the fertile plains of B.E.A, from the domain of
savagery declare that the African buffalo, the zebra, the kongoni
and the elephant are public nuisances that must be suppressed by the
rifle.
</p>
<p>
Even the most ardent friend of wild life must admit that when a
settler has laboriously fenced his fields, and plowed and sowed,
only to have his whole crop ruined in one night by a herd of
fence-breaking zebras, the event is sufficient to abrade the nerves
of the party most in interest. While I take no stock in stories of
dozens of "rogue" elephants that require treatment with the rifle,
and of grown men being imperiled by savage gazelles, we admit that
there are times when wild animals can make nuisances of themselves.
Let us consider that subject now.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Wild Animal Nuisances. </span> &mdash;Complaints have come to me, at various times, of great destruction of lambs by eagles; of trout by blue herons; of crops (on Long Island) by deer; of pears destroyed by birds, and of valuable park trees by beavers that chop down trees not wisely but too well. I do not, however, include in this category any cherries eaten by robins, or orioles, or jays; for they are of too small importance to consider in this court.
</p>

</center>
<p class="captionheading">
	A FOOD SUPPLY OF WHITE-TAILED DEER
</p>
<p class="captionsubheading">
	The Killing of the Does was Wrong
</p>
<p>
To meet the legitimate demands for the abatement of unbearable
wild-animal nuisances, I recommend the enactment of a law similar to
Section 158 of the Game laws of New York, which provides for the
safe and legitimate abatement of unbearable wild creatures as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
	Section 158. <i> Power to Take Birds and Quadrupeds</i>. In the event that any species of birds protected by the provisions of section two hundred and nineteen of this article, or quadrupeds protected by law, shall at any time, in any locality, become destructive of private or public property, the commission shall have power in its discretion to direct any game protector, or issue a permit to any citizen of the state, to take such species of birds or quadrupeds and dispose of the same in such manner as the commission may provide. Such permit shall expire within four months after the date of issuance.
</blockquote>
<p>
This measure should be adopted by every state that is troubled by
too many, or too aggressive, wild mammals or birds.
</p>
<p>
But to return to the subject of big game and farming. We do not
complain of the disappearance of the bison, elk, deer and bear from
the farms of the United States and Canada. The passing of the big
game from all such regions follows the advance of real civilization,
just so surely and certainly as night follows day.
</p>
<p>
But this vast land of ours is not wholly composed of rich
agricultural lands; not by any means. There are millions of acres of
forest lands, good, bad and indifferent, worth from nothing per acre
up to one hundred <a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page236] </span> </a> dollars or more. There are
millions of acres of rocky, brush-covered mountains and hills,
wholly unsuited to agriculture, or even horticulture. There are
other millions of acres of arid plains and arboreal deserts, on
which nothing but thirst-proof animals can live and thrive. The
South contains vast pine forests and cypress swamps, millions of
acres of them, of which the average northerner knows less than
nothing.
</p>
<p>
We can not stop long enough to look it up, but from the green color
on our national map that betokens the forest reserves, and from our
own personal knowledge of the deserts, swamps, barrens and rocks
that we have seen, we make the estimate that <i> fully one-third
</i> of the total area of the United States is incapable of
supporting the husbandman who depends for his existence upon tillage
of the soil. People may talk and write about "dry farming" all they
please, but I wish to observe that from Dry-Farming to Success is a
long shot, with many limbs in the way. When it rains sufficiently,
dry farming is a success; but otherwise it is not; and we heartily
wish it were otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The logical conclusion of our land that is utterly unfit for
agriculture is a great area of land available for occupancy by
valuable wild animals. Every year the people of the United States
are wasting uncountable millions of pounds of venison, because we
are neglecting our opportunities for producing it practically
without cost. Imagine for a moment bestowing upon land owners the
ability to stock with white-tailed and Indian sambar deer all the
wild lands of the United States that are suitable for those species,
and permitting only bucks over one year of age to be shot. With the
does even reasonably protected, the numerical results in annual
pounds of good edible flesh fairly challenges the imagination.
</p>
<p>
About six years ago, Mr. C.C. Worthington's deer, in his fenced
park, at Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania, became so numerous and
so burdensome that he opened his fences and permitted about one
thousand head to go free.
</p>
<p>
We are losing each year a very large and valuable asset in the
intangible form of a million hardy deer that we might have raised
but did not! Our vast domains of wooded mountains, hills and valleys
lie practically untenanted by big game, save in a few exceptional
spots. We lose because we are lawless. We lose because we are too
improvident to conserve large forms of wild life unless we are
compelled to do so by the stern edict of the law! The law-breakers,
the game-hogs, the conscienceless doe-and-fawn slayers are
everywhere! Ten per cent of all the grown men now in the United
States are to-day poachers, thieves and law-breakers, or else they
are liable to become so to-morrow. If you doubt it, try risking your

We could raise two million deer each year on our empty wild lands;
but without fences it would take half a million real game-wardens,
on duty <a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page237] </span> </a> from dawn until dark, to protect them from
destructive slaughter. At present our land of liberty contains only
9,354 game wardens. <a name="FNanchorJ" id="FNanchorJ"> </a> <a
class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_J"> [J] </a> The states that
contain the greatest areas of wild lands naturally lack in
population and in tax funds, and not one such state can afford to
put into the field even half enough salaried game wardens to really
protect her game from surreptitious slaughter. The surplus of
"personal liberty" in this liberty-cursed land is a curse to the big
game. The average frontiersman never will admit the divine right of
kings, but he does ardently believe in the divine right of
settlers,&mdash;to reach out and take any of the products of Nature
that they happen to fancy.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Wild Meat As A Food Supply. </span> &mdash;We hear much these days about the high cost of living, but thus far we have made no move to mend the situation. With coal going straight up to ten dollars per ton, beef going up to fifteen dollars per hundred on the hoof and wheat and hay going-up&mdash;heaven alone knows where, it is time for all Americans who are not rich to arouse and take thought for the morrow. <i> What are we going to do about it</i>? The tariff on the coarser necessities of life is now booked to come down; but what about the fresh meat supply?
</p>
<p>
I desire to point out that between Bangor and San Diego and from Key
West to Bellingham, our country contains millions of acres of wild,
practically uninhabited forests, rough foot-hills, bad-lands and
mountains that could produce two million deer each year, without
deducting $50,000 a year from the wealth of the country. I grant
that in the total number of deer that would be necessary to produce
two million deer per annum, the farms situated on the edges of
forests, and actually within the forests, would suffer somewhat from
the depredations of those deer. As I will presently show by
documentary records, every one of those individual damages that
exceeds two dollars in value could be compensated in cash, and
afterward leave on the credit side of the deer account an enormous
annual balance.
</p>
<p>
Stop for a moment, you enterprising and restless men and women who
travel all over the United States, and think of the illimitable
miles of unbroken forest that you have looked upon from your Pullman
windows in the East, in the South, in the West and in southern
Canada. Recall the wooded mountains of the Appalachian system, the
White Mountain region, the pine forests of the Atlantic Coast and
the Gulf States, the forests of Tennessee, Arkansas and southern
Missouri; of northern Minnesota, and every state of the Rocky
Mountain region. Then, think of the silent and untouched forests of
the Pacific Coast and tell me whether you think five million deer
scattered through all those forests would make any visible
impression upon them. That would be only about twenty-five times as
many as are there now! I think the forests would not be over
populated; and they would produce <i> two million killable deer each
year</i>!
</p>
<p>
Last year, 11,000 deer were forced down out of their hiding places
in <a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page238] </span> </a> the Rocky Mountains, and were killed in
Montana. Even the natives had not dreamed there were so many
available; and they were slaughtered not wisely but too ill. It is
not right that six members of one family should "hog" twelve deer in
one season. At present no deer supply can stand such slaughter.
</p>
<p>
Assuming that the people of the United States <i> could </i> be
educated into the idea of so conserving deer that they could draw
two million head per year from the general stock, what would it be
worth?
</p>
<p>
It is not very difficult to estimate the value of a deer, when the
whole animal can be utilized. In various portions of the United
States, deer vary in size, but I shall take all this into account,
and try to strike a fair average. In some sections, where deer are
large and heavy, a full-grown buck is easily worth twenty-five
dollars. Let him who doubts it, try to replace those generous pounds
of flesh with purchased beef and mutton and veal, and see how far
twenty-five dollars will go toward it. Every man who is a
householder knows full well how little meat one dollar will buy at
this time.
</p>
<p>
I think that throughout the United States as a whole every
full-grown deer, male or female contains on an average ten dollars
worth of good meat. I know of one large preserve which annually
sells its surplus of deer at that price, wholesale, to dealers; and
in New York City (doubtless in many other cities, also) venison
often has sold in the market at one dollar per pound!
</p>
<p>
Two million deer at $10 each mean $20,000,000. The licenses for the
killing of two million deer should cost one million men one dollar
each; and that would pay 1,666 new game wardens each fifty dollars
per month, all the year round. The damages that would need to be
paid to farmers, on account of crops injured by deer, would be so
small that each county could take care of its own cases, from its
own treasury, as is done in the State of Vermont.
</p>
<p>
There are certain essentials to the realization of a dream of two
million deer per year that are absolutely required. They are neither
obscure nor impossible.
</p>
<p>
Each state and each county proposing to stock its vacant woods with
deer must resolutely educate its own people in the necessity of
playing fair about the killing of deer, and giving every man and
every deer a square deal. This is <i> not </i> impossible! Not as a
general thing, even though it may be so in some specially lawless
communities. If the <i> leading men </i> of the state and the county
will take this matter seriously in hand, it can be done in two
years' time. The American people are not insensible to appeals to
reason, when those appeals are made by their own "home folks." The
governors, senators, assemblymen, judges, mayors and justices of the
peace could, <i> if they would</i>, make a campaign of education and
appeal that would result in the creation of an immense volume of
free wild food in every state that possesses wild lands.
</p>
<p>
When the shoe of Necessity pinches the People hard enough, remember
the possibilities in deer.

</p>
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page240] </span> </a>
<p>
The best wild animal to furnish a serious food supply is the
white-tailed deer. This is because of its persistence and fertility.
The elk is too large for general use. An elk carcass can not be
carried on a horse; it is impossible to get a sled or a wagon to
where it lies; and so, fully half of it usually is wasted! The mule
deer is good for the Rocky Mountains, and can live where the
white-tail can not; but it is <i> too easy to shoot</i>! The
Columbian black-tail is the natural species for the forests of the
Pacific states; but it is a trifle small in size.
</p>

	<span class="title"> The Example Of Vermont. </span> &mdash;In order to show that all the above is not based on empty theory,&mdash;regarding the stocking of forests with deer, their wonderful powers of increase, and the practical handling of the damage question,&mdash;let us take the experience and the fine example of Vermont.
</p>
<p>
In April, 1875, a few sportsmen of Rutland, of whom the late Henry
W. Cheney was one, procured in the Adirondacks thirteen white-tailed
deer, six bucks and seven does. These were liberated in a forest six
miles from Rutland, and beyond being protected from slaughter, they
were left to shift for themselves. They increased, slowly at first,
then rapidly, and by 1897, they had become so numerous that it
seemed right to have a short annual open season, and kill a few.
From first to last, many of those deer have been killed contrary to
law. In 1904-5, it was known that 294 head were destroyed in that
way; and undoubtedly there were others that were not reported.

	<span class="title"> Value Of White-Tailed Deer. </span> &mdash;Having noted the fact that in two years (1908-9), the people of Vermont paid out $4,865 in compensation for damages inflicted by deer, it is of interest to determine whether that money was wisely expended. In other words, did it pay?
</p>
<p>
We have seen that in the years 1908 and 9, the people of Vermont
killed, legally and illegally, and converted to use, 7,186 deer.
This does not include the deer killed by dogs and by accidents.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the value of a full-grown deer, it must be remembered that
much depends upon the locality of the carcass. In New York or
Pittsburg or Chicago, a whole deer is worth, at wholesale, at least
twenty-five dollars. In Vermont, where deer are plentiful, they are
worth a less sum. I think that fifteen dollars would be a fair
figure,&mdash;at least low enough!
</p>
<p>
Even when computed at fifteen dollars per carcass, those deer were
worth to the people of Vermont $107,790. It would seem, therefore,
that the soundness of Vermont's policy leaves no room for argument;
and we hope that other states, and also private individuals, will
profit by Vermont's very successful experiment in bringing back the
deer to her forests, and in increasing the food supply of her
people.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Killing Female Deer. </span> &mdash;To say one word on this subject which might by any possibility be construed as favoring it, is like juggling with a lighted torch over a barrel of gunpowder. Already, in Pennsylvania at least one gentleman has appeared anxious to represent me as favoring the killing of does, which in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of every thousand I distinctly and emphatically do not. The slaughter of female hoofed game animals is necessarily destructive and reprehensible, and not one man out of every ten thousand in this country ever will see the place and time wherein the opposite is true.
</p>
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page242] </span> </a>
<p>
At present there are just two places in America, and I think only
two, wherein there exists the slightest exception on this point. The
state of Vermont is becoming overstocked with deer, and the females
have in <i> some </i> counties (not in all), become so tame and
destructive in orchards, gardens and farm crops as to constitute a
great annoyance. For this reason, the experiment is being made of
permitting does to be killed under license, until their number is
somewhat reduced.
</p>
<p>
The first returns from this trial have now come in, from the county
game wardens of Vermont to the state game warden. Mr. John W.
Titcomb. I will quote the gist of the opinion of each.
</p>
<p>
The State Commissioner says: "This law should remain in force at
least until there is some indication of a decrease in the number of
deer." Warden W.H. Taft (Addison County) says: "The killing of does
I believe did away with a good many of these tame deer that cause
most of the damage to farmers' crops." Harry Chase (Bennington
County) says the doe-killing law is "a good law, and I sincerely
trust it will not be repealed." Warden Hayward of Rutland County
says: "The majority of the farmers in this county are in favor of
repealing the doe law.... A great many does and young deer (almost
fawns) were killed in this county during the hunting season of
1909." R.W. Wheeler, of Rutland County says: "Have the doe law
repealed! We don't need it!" H.J. Parcher of Washington County finds
that the does did more damage to the crops than the bucks, and he
thinks the doe law is "a just one." R.L. Frost, of Windham County,
judicially concludes that "the law allowing does to be killed should
remain in force one or two seasons more." C.S Parker, of Orleans
County, says his county is not overstocked with deer, and he favors
a special act for his county, to protect females.
</p>
<p>
A summary of the testimony of the wardens is easily made. When deer
are too plentiful, and the over-tame does become a public nuisance
too great to be endured, the number should be reduced by regular
shooting in the open season; but,
</p>
<p>
As soon as the proper balance of deer life has been restored,
protect the does once more.
</p>
<p>
The pursuit of this policy is safe and sane, provided it can be
wrought out without the influence of selfishness, and reckless
disregard for the rights of the next generation. On the whole, its
handling is like playing with fire, and I think there are very, very
few states on this earth wherein it would be wise or safe to try it.
As a wise friend once remarked to me, "Give some men a hinch, and
they'll always try to take a hell." In Vermont, however, the
situation is kept so well in hand we may be sure that at the right
moment the law providing for the decrease of the number of does will
be repealed.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Hippopotami And Antelopes. </span> &mdash;Last year a bill was introduced in the lower House of Congress proposing to provide funds for the introduction into certain southern states of various animals from Africa, especially hippopotami and African antelopes. The former were proposed partly for <a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page243] </span> </a> the purpose of ridding navigation of the water hyacinths that now are choking many of the streams of Louisiana and Mississippi. The antelopes were to be acclimatized as a food supply for the people at large.
</p>
<p>
This measure well illustrates the prevailing disposition of the
American people to-day,&mdash;to ignore and destroy their own
valuable natural stock of wild birds and mammals, and when they have
completed their war of extermination, reach out to foreign countries
for foreign species. Instead of preserving the deer of the South,
the South reaches out for the utterly impossible antelopes of
Africa, and the preposterous hippopotamus. The North joyously
exterminates her quail and ruffed grouse, and goes to Europe for the
Hungarian partridge. That partridge is a failure here, and I am <i>
heartily glad of it</i>, on the ground that the exterminators of our
native species do not deserve success in their efforts to displace
our finest native species with others from abroad.
</p>
<p>
The hippo-antelope proposition is a climax of absurdity, in
proposing the replacing of valuable native game with impossible
foreign species.

		LAW AND SENTIMENT AS FACTORS IN PRESERVATION
	</div>
</div>
<p>
There is grave danger that through ignorance of the true character
of about 80 per cent of the men and boys who shoot wild creatures, a
great wrong will be done the latter. Let us not make a fatal
mistake.
</p>
<p>
After more than thirty years of observation among all kinds of
sportsmen, hunters and gunners, I am convinced that it is utterly
futile and deadly dangerous to rely on humane, high-class sentiment
to diminish the slaughter of wild things by game-hogs and
pot-hunters.
</p>
<p>
In some respects, the term "game-hog" is a rude, rough word; but it
is needed in the English language, and it has come to stay. It is a
disagreeable term, but it was brought into use to apply to a class
of very disagreeable persons.
</p>
<p>
A "game-hog" is a hunter of game who knows no such thing as
sentiment or conscience in the killing of game, so long as he keeps
within the limit of the law. Regardless of the scarcity of game, or
of its hard struggle for existence, he will kill right up to the bag
limit every day that he goes out, provided it is possible to do so.
He uses the "law" as a salve for the spot where his conscience
should be. He will shoot with any machine gun, or gun of big
calibre, in every way that the law allows, and he knows no such
thing as giving the game a square deal. He brags of his big bags of
game, and he loves to be photographed with a wagon-load of dead
birds as a background. He believes in automatic and pump guns,
spring shooting, longer open seasons and "more game." He is quite
content to shoot half tame ducks in a club preserve as they fly
between coop and pond, whenever he secures an opportunity. He will
gladly sell his game whenever he can do so without being found out,
and sometimes when he is.
</p>
<p>
Often a true sportsman drifts without realizing it into some one way
of the confirmed game-hog; but the moment he is made to realize his
position, he changes his course and his standing. The game-hog is
impervious to argument. You can shame a horse away from his oats
more easily than you can shame him from doing "what the Law allows."
</p>
<p>
There are hundreds of thousands of gentlemen and gentlewomen who
never once have come in touch with real cloven-footed game-hogs, who
do not understand the species at all, and do not recognize its
ear-marks. Thousands of such persons will tell you: "In my opinion,
the best way to save the wild life is to <i> educate the
people</i>!" I have heard that, many, many times.
</p>
<p>
For right-hearted people, a little law is quite sufficient; and the
best <a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page245] </span> </a> people need none at all! But the game-hogs
are different. For them, the strict letter of the law, backed up by
a strong-arm squad, is the only controlling influence that they
recognize. To them it is necessary to say: "You shall!" and "You
shall not!"
</p>
<p>
Only yesterday the latest game-hog case was related to me by a
game-protector from Kansas. Into a certain county of southern
Kansas, from which the prairie-chicken had been totally gone for a
dozen years or more, a pair of those birds entered, settled down and
nested. Their coming was to many habitants a joyous event. "Now,"
said the People, "we will care for these birds, and they will
multiply, and presently the county will be restocked."
</p>
<p>
But Ahab came! Two men from another county, calling themselves
sportsmen but not entitled to that name, heard of those birds, and
resolved to "get them." They waited until the young were just
leaving the nest: and they went down and camped near by. On the
first day they killed the two parent birds and half the flock of
young birds, and the next day they got all the rest.
</p>
<p>
But there is a sequel to this story. One of those men was a dealer
in guns and ammunition; and when his customers heard what he had
done, "they simply put him out of business, by refusing to trade
with him any more." He is now washing dirty dishes in a restaurant;
but at heart he is a game-hog, just the same.
</p>
<p>
Near Bridgeport, Connecticut, a gentleman of my acquaintance owns a
fine estate which is adorned with a trout stream and a superfine
trout pond. Once he invited a business man of Bridgeport to be his
guest, and fish for trout in his pond. On that guest, during a visit
of three days all the finest forms of hospitality were bestowed.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks later, my friend's game-warden caught that guest, early on
a Sunday morning, <i> poaching </i> on the trout-pond, and spoiled
his carefully arranged get-away.
</p>
<p>
In his book "Saddle and Camp in the Rockies," Mr. Dillon Wallace
tells a story of a man from New York who in the mountains of
Colorado deliberately corrupted his guides with money or other
influences, shot mountain sheep <i> in midsummer</i>, and "got away
with it."
</p>
<p>
In northern Minnesota, George E. Wood has been having a hand-to-hand
fight with the worst community of game-hogs and alien-born poachers
of which I have heard. There appears to be no game law that they do
not systematically violate. The killers seem determined to
annihilate the last head of game, in spite of fines and
imprisonments. The foreigners are absolutely uncontrollable. The
latest feature of the war is the discovery of a tannery in the
woods, where the hides of illegally-slaughtered deer and moose are
dressed. Apparently the only kind of a law that will save the game
of northern Minnesota is one that will totally disarm the entire
population.
</p>
<p>
In Pennsylvania, there exists an association which was formed for
the <a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page246] </span> </a> express purpose of fighting the State Game
Commission, preventing the enactment of a hunter's license law and
repealing the law against the killing of female deer and hornless
fawns. The continued existence of that organization on that basis
would be a standing disgrace to the fair name of Pennsylvania. I
think, however, that that organization was founded on secret selfish
purposes, and that ere long the general body of members will awaken
to a realizing sense of their position, and range themselves in
support of the excellent policies of the commission.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> A Pot-Hunter </span> is a man or boy who kills game as a business, for the money that can be derived from its sale, or other use. Such men have the same feelings as butchers. From their point of view, they can see no reason why all the game in the world should not be killed and marketed. Like the feather-dealers, they wish to get out of the wild life all the money there is in it; that is all. Left to themselves, with open markets they would soon exterminate the land fauna of the habitable portions of the globe.
</p>
<p>
No one can "educate" such people. For the gunners, game-hogs and
pot-hunters, there is no check, save specific laws that sternly and
amply safeguard the rights of the wild creatures that can not make
laws for themselves.
</p>
<p>
Nor can anyone educate the heartless woman of fashion who is
determined to wear aigrettes as long as her money can buy them. The
best women of the world have <i> already been educated </i> on the
bird-millinery subject, and they are already against the use of the
gaudy badges of slaughter and extermination. But in the great cities
of the world there are thousands of women who are at heart as cruel
as Salome herself, and whose vicious tastes can be curbed only by
the strong hand of the law. "Sentiment" for wild birds is not in
them.
</p>
<p>
Because of the vicious and heartless elements among men and women,
we say, Give us <i> far-reaching, iron-bound </i> LAWS for the
protection of wild life, <i> and plenty of courageous men to enforce
them</i>.

		CHAPTER XXVI
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		THE ARMY OF THE DEFENSE
	</div>
</div>
<p>
It now seems that the friends of wild life who themselves are not on
the firing-line should be afforded some definite information
regarding the Army of the Defense, and its strength and weakness. It
is an interesting subject, but the limitations of space will not
permit an extended treatment.
</p>
<p>
Over the world at large, I think the active Destroyers outnumber the
active Defenders of wild life at least in the ratio of 500 to 1; and
the money available to the Destroyers is to the funds of the
Defenders as 500 is to 1. The <i> average </i> big-game sportsman
cheerfully expends from $500 to $1,000 on a hunting trip, but
resents the suggestion that he should subscribe from $50 to $100 for
wild life preservation. If he puts down $10, he thinks he has done a
Big Thing. Worse than this, I am forced to believe that at least 75
per cent of the big-game sportsmen of the world never have
contributed one dollar in money, or one hour of effort, to that
cause. But there are exceptions; and I can name at least fifty
sportsmen who have subscribed $100 each to campaign funds, and some
who have given as high as $1,000.
</p>
<p>
Once I sat down beside a financially rich slaughterer of game, and
asked him to subscribe a sum of real money in behalf of a very
important campaign. I needed funds very much; and I explained,
exhorted and besought. I pointed out his duty&mdash;<i>to give back
something </i> in return for all the game slaughter that he had <i>
enjoyed</i>. For ten long minutes he stood fire without flinching,
and without once opening his lips to speak. He made no answer no
argument, no defense and finally he never gave up one cent.
</p>
<p>
Wherever the English language is spoken, from Tasmania to Scotland,
and from Porto Rico to the Philippines, the spirit of wild life
protection exists. Elsewhere there is much more to be said on this
point. To all cosmopolitan sportsmen, the British "Blue Book" on
game protection, the annual reports of the two great protective
societies of London, and the annual "Progress" report of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture are reassuring and comforting. It is good
to know that Uganda maintains a Department of Game Protection (A.L.
Butler, Superintendent), that so good a man as Maj. J.
Stevenson-Hamilton is in control of protection in the Transvaal, and
that even the native State of Kashmir officially recognizes the need
to protect the Remnant.
</p>
<p>
There are of course many parts of the world in which game laws and
limits to slaughter are quite unknown: all of which is entirely
wrong, and in need of quick correction. No state or nation can be
accounted <a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page248] </span> </a> wholly civilized that fails to recognize the
necessity to protect wild life. I am tempted to make a list of the
states and nations that were at latest advices destitute of game
laws and game protectors, but I fear to do injustice through lack of
the latest information. However, the time has come to search out
delinquents, and hold up to each one a mirror that will reflect its
shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, we are most interested in our own contingent of the Army
of the Defense.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The United States Government. </span> &mdash;To-day the feeling in Congress, toward the conservation of wild life and forests is admirable. Both houses are fully awake to the necessity of saving while there is yet something to be saved. The people of the United States may be assured that the national government is active and sympathetic in the prosecution of such conservation measures as it might justly be expected to promote. For example, during the past five years we have seen Congress take favorable action on the following important causes, nearly every one of which cost money:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The saving of the American bison, in four National ranges.
	</li>
	<li>
		The creation of fifty-eight bird refuges.
	</li>
	<li>
		The creation of five great game preserves.
	</li>
	<li>
		The saving of the elk in Jackson Hole.
	</li>
	<li>
		The protection of the fur seal.
	</li>
	<li>
		The protection of the wild life of Alaska.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many active friends of wild life who confidently expect to
see this fine list gloriously rounded out by the passage in 1913 of
an ideal bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds. To
name the friends of wild life in Congress would require the printing
of a list of at least two hundred names, and a history of the rise
and progress of wild life conservation by the national government
would fill a volume. Such a volume would be highly desirable.
</p>
<p>
When the story of the national government's part in wild-life
protection is finally written, it will be found that while he was
president, <span class="list"> <span class="title"> Theodore
Roosevelt </span> </span> made a record in that field that is indeed
enough to make a reign illustrious. He aided every wild-life cause
that lay within the bounds of possibility, and he gave the vanishing
birds and mammals the benefit of every doubt. He helped to establish
three national bison herds, four national game preserves,
fifty-three federal bird refuges, and to enact the Alaska game laws
of 1902 and 1907.
</p>
<p>
It was in 1904 that the national government elected to accept its
share of the white man's burden and enter actively into the
practical business of wild life protection. This special work,
originally undertaken and down to the present vigorously carried on
by Dr. Theodore S. Palmer, has considerably changed the working
policy of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture,
and greatly influenced game protection throughout the states. The
game protection work of that bureau is alone worth to the people of
this country at least twenty times more per annum than the entire
annual cost of the Bureau. Next to the splendid services of Dr.
Palmer, all over the United States, one great value of the Bureau is
found in the fact-and-figure ammunition that it prepares and
distributes for general use in assaults on the citadels of Ignorance
and Greed. The publications of the Bureau are of great practical
value to the people of the United States.

	NOTABLE PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE (I)
</p>
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page250] </span> </a>
<p>
Dr. Palmer is a man of incalculable value to the cause of
protection. No call for advice is too small to receive his immediate
attention, no fight is too hot and no danger-point too remote to
keep him from the fray. Wherever the Army of Destruction is making a
particularly dangerous fight to repeal good laws and turn back the
wheels of progress, there will he be found. As the warfare grows
more intense, Congress may find it necessary to enlarge the fighting
force of the Biological Survey.
</p>
<p>
The work that has been done by the Bureau in determining the
economic value or lack of value of our most important species of
insectivorous birds, has been worth millions to the agricultural
interests of the United States. Through it we know where we stand.
The reasons why we need to strive for protection can be expressed in
figures and percentages; and it seems to me that they leave the
American people no option but to <i> protect</i>!
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> State Game Commissions. </span> &mdash;Each of our states, and each province of Canada, maintains either a State Game Commission of several persons, one Commissioner, or a State Game Warden. All such officers are officially charged with the duty of looking after the general welfare of the game and other wild life of their respective states. Theoretically one of the chief duties of a State Game Commission is to initiate new legislative bills that are necessary, and advocate their translation into law. The official standing of most game commissioners is such that they can successfully do this. In 1909 Governor Hughes of New York went so far as to let it be known that he would sign no new game bill that did not meet the approval of State Game Commissioner James S. Whipple. As a general working principle, and quite aside from Mr. Whipple, that was wrong; because even a State game commissioner is not necessarily infallible, or always on the right side of every wild-life question.
</p>
<p>
As a rule, state commissioners and state wardens are keenly alive to
the needs of their states in new game protective legislation, and a
large percentage of the best existing laws are due to their
initiative. Often, however, their usefulness is limited by the
trammels of public office, and there are times when such officers
can not be too aggressive without the risk of arousing hostile
influences, and handicapping their own departmental work. For this
reason, it is often advisable that bills which propose great and
drastic reforms, and which are likely to become storm-centers,
should originate outside the Commissioner's office, and be pushed by
men who are perfectly free to abide the fortunes of open warfare. It
should be distinctly understood, however, that lobbying in behalf of
wild-life measures is <i> an important part of the legitimate duty
of every state game commissioner</i>, and is a most honorable
calling.

	NOTABLE PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE (II)
</p>
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page252] </span> </a>
<p>
Of the many strong and aggressive state game commissions that I
would like to mention in detail, space permits the naming of only a
very few, by way of illustration.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> New York. </span> &mdash;Thanks to the great conservation Governor of this state, John A. Dix, the year 1911 saw our forest, fish and game business established on an ideal business basis. Realizing the folly of requiring a single man to manage those three great interests, and render to each the attention that it deserves and requires, by a well-studied legislative act a State Conservation Commission was created, consisting of three commissioners, one for each of the three great natural departments. These are salaried officers, who devote their entire time to their work, and are properly equipped with assistants. The state force of game wardens now consists of 125 picked men, each on a salary of $900 per year, and through a rigid system of daily reports (inaugurated by John B. Burnham) the activities and results of each warden promptly become known in detail at headquarters.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, New York contains a very large number of true
sportsmen, who are ever ready to come forward in support of every
great measure for wild-life protection. The spirit of real
protection runs throughout the state, and in time I predict that it
will result in a great recovery of the native game of the
commonwealth. That will be after we have stopped all shooting of
upland game birds and shore birds for about eight years. Even the
pinnated grouse could be successfully introduced over one-third of
the state, if the people would have it so. It was our great body of
conscientious sportsmen who made possible the Bayne-Blauvelt law,
and the new codification of the game laws of the state.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Tennessee. </span> &mdash;Clearly, Honorable Mention belongs to the unsalaried State Commissioner of Tennessee, Col. J.H. Acklen, "than whom," says Dr. Palmer, "there is no more active and enthusiastic game protectionist in this country. Whatever has been accomplished in that state is due to his activity and public spirit. Col. Acklen, who is now president of the National Association of Game Commissioners, is a prominent lawyer, and enjoys the distinction of being the only commissioner in the country who not only serves without pay, but also defrays a large part of the expenses of game protection out of his own pocket."
</p>
<p>
Surely the Commonwealth of Tennessee will not long permit this
unsupported condition of such a game commissioner to endure. That
state has a wild fauna worth preserving for her sons and grandsons,
and it is inconceivable that the funds vitally necessary to this
public service can not be found.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Alabama. </span> &mdash;I cite the case of Alabama because, in view of its position in a group of states that until recently have cared little about game protection, it may be regarded as an unusual case. Commissioner John H. Wallace, Jr., has evolved order out of chaos,&mdash;and something approaching a reign of law out of the absence of law. To-day the State of Alabama stands as an example of what can be accomplished by and through one clear-headed, determined man who is right, and knows that he is right.
</p>
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page253] </span> </a>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> New Jersey. </span> &mdash;Alabama reminds one of New Jersey, and of State Game Commissioner Ernest Napier. I have seen him on the firing-line, and I know that his strong devotion to the interests of the wild life of his state, his determination to protect it at all costs, and his resistless confidence in asking for what is right, have made him a power for good. The state legislature believes in him, and enacts the laws that he says are right and necessary. He serves without salary, and gives to the state time, labor and money. It is a pleasure to work with such a man. In 1912 Commissioner Napier won a pitched battle with the makers of automatic and pump guns, both shotguns and rifles, and debarred all those weapons from use <i> in hunting </i> in New Jersey unless satisfactorily reduced to two shots.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Massachusetts. </span> &mdash;The state of Massachusetts is fortunate in the possession of a very fine corps of ornithologists, nature lovers, sportsmen and leading citizens who on all questions affecting wild life occupy high ground and are not afraid to maintain it. It would be a pleasure to write an entire chapter on this subject. The record of the Massachusetts Army of the Defense is both an example and an inspiration to the people of other states. Not only is the cause of protection championed by the State Game Commission but it also receives constant and powerful support from the State Board of Agriculture, which maintains on its staff Mr. E.H. Forbush as State Ornithologist. The bird-protection publications of the Board are of great economic value, and they are also an everlasting credit to the state. The very latest is a truly great wild-life-protection volume of 607 pages, by Mr. Forbush, entitled "<i>Game Birds, Wild-Fowl and Shore Birds</i>." It is a publication most damaging to the cause of the Army of Destruction, and I heartily wish a million copies might be printed and placed in the hands of lawmakers and protectors.
</p>
<p>
The fight last winter and spring for a no-sale-of-game law was the
Gettysburg for Massachusetts. The voice of the People was heard in
no uncertain tones, and the Destroyers were routed all along the
line. The leaders in that struggle on the protection side were E.H.
Forbush, William P. Wharton, Dr. George W. Field, Edward N. Goding,
Lyman E. Hurd, Ralph Holman, Rev. Wm. R. Lord and Salem D. Charles.
With such leaders and such supporters, any wild-life cause can be
won, anywhere!
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Pennsylvania. </span> &mdash;The case of Pennsylvania is rather peculiar. As yet there is no large and resistless organized body of real sportsmen to rally to the support of the State Game Commission in great causes, as is the case in New York. As a result, with a paltry fund of only $20,000 for annual maintenance, and much opposition from hunters and farmers, the situation is far from satisfactory. Fortunately Dr. Joseph Kalbfus, Secretary of the Commission and chief executive officer, is a man of indomitable courage and determination. But for this state of mind he would ere this have given up the fight for the hunter's license law (of one dollar per year), which has been bitterly opposed by a very aggressive and noisy group of gunners who do not seem to know that they are grievously misled.
</p>
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page254] </span> </a>
<p>
Fortunately, Commissioner John M. Phillips, of Pittsburgh is the
ardent supporter of Dr. Kalbfus and a vigorous fighter for justice
to wild life. He devotes to the cause a great amount of time and
effort, and in addition to serving without salary he pays all his
campaign expenses out of his own pocket. His only recompense for all
this is the sincere admiration of his friends, and the consciousness
of having done his full duty toward the wild life and the people of
his native state.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The State Audubon Societies. </span> &mdash;It is impossible to estimate the full value of the influence and work of the State Audubon Societies of the United States. Thus far these societies exist in thirty-nine states. From the beginning, their efforts have tended especially toward the preservation of the non-game birds, and it is well that the song and other insectivorous birds have thus been specially championed. Unfortunately, however, if that policy is pursued exclusively, it leaves 154 very important species of game birds practically at the mercy of the Army of Destruction! It would seem that the time has come when all Audubon Societies should take up, as a part of their work, active co-operation in helping to save the game birds from extermination.
</p>

<p class="centerheading">
	The National Organizations Of New York City
</p>
<p>
On January 1, 1895, the United States of America contained, so far
as I am aware, not one organization of national scope which was
devoting any large amount of its resources and activities to the
protection of wild life. At that time the former activities of the
A.O.U. Committee on Bird Protection had lapsed. To-day the city of
New York contains six national organizations, and it is now a great
center of nation-wide activities in behalf of preservation.
Furthermore, these activities are steadily growing, and securing
practical results.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The New York Zoological Society. </span> &mdash;In 1895 there was born into the world a scientific organization having for its second declared object "the preservation of our native animals." It was the first scientific society or corporation ever formed, so far as I am aware, having a specifically declared object of that kind. It owes its existence and its presence in the field of wild-life conservation to the initiative and persistence of Mr. Madison Grant and Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn. For sixteen years these two officers have worked together virtually as one man. It is not strange to find a sportsman like Mr. Grant promoting the wild-life cause, but it is a fact well worthy of note that of all the zoologists of the world, Professor Osborn is the only one of real renown who has actively and vigorously engaged in this cause, and taken a place in the front rank of the Defenders.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Grant's influence on the protection cause has been strong and
far-reaching,&mdash;far more so than the majority of his own friends
are aware. He has promoted important protectionist causes from
Alaska to Louisiana and Newfoundland, and helped to win many
important victories.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Boone And Crockett Club. </span> &mdash;This organization of big game sportsmen was founded in 1885, and is the oldest of its kind in the United States. Its members always have supported the cause of protection, by law and by the making of game preserves. In all this work Mr. George Bird Grinnell, for twenty-five years editor of <i> Forest and Stream</i>, has been an important factor. As stated elsewhere, the club's written and unwritten code of ethics in big-game hunting is very strict. In course of time a Committee on Game Protection was formed, and it actively entered that field.

<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page256] </span> </a>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The National Association Of Audubon Societies. </span> &mdash;This organization was founded by William Dutcher, in 1902, and in 1906 it was endowed to the extent of $322,000 by the bequest of Albert Wilcox. Subsequent endowments, together with the annual contributions of members and friends, now give the Association an annual income of $60,000. It maintains eight widely-separated field agents and lecturers and forty special game wardens of bird refuges. It maintains Secretary T. Gilbert Pearson and a number of other good men constantly on the firing-line; and these forces have achieved many valuable results. After years of stress and struggle, it now seems almost certain that this organization will save the two white egrets,&mdash;producers of "the white badge of cruelty,"&mdash;to the bird fauna of the United States, as in a similar manner it has saved the gulls, terns and other sea birds of our lakes and coast line.
</p>
<p>
This splendid organization is one of the monuments to William
Dutcher. More than two years ago he was stricken with paralysis, and
now sits in an invalid's chair at his home in Plainfield, New
Jersey. His mind is clear and his interest in wild-life protection
is keen, but he is unable to speak or to write. While he was active,
he was one of the most resourceful and fearless champions of the
cause of the vanishing birds. To him the farmers of America owe ten
times more than they ever will know, and a thousand times more than
they ever will repay, either to him or to his cause.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Camp-Fire Club Of America. </span> &mdash;Although founded in 1897, this organization did not, as an organization, actively enter the field of protection until 1909. Since that time its work has covered a wide field, and enlisted the activities of many of its members. In order to provide a permanent fund for its work, each year the club members pay special annual dues that are devoted solely to the wild-life cause. The Committee on Game Protective Legislation and Preserves is a strong, hard-working body, and it has rendered good service in the lines of activity named in its title.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The American Game Protective And Propagation Association. </span> &mdash;This is the youngest protective organization of national scope, having been organized in 1911. Its activities are directed by John B. Burnham, for five years Chief Game Protector of the State of New York, and a man thoroughly conversant with the business of protection. The organization is financed chiefly by means of a large annual fund contributed by several of the largest companies engaged in manufacturing firearms and <a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page257] </span> </a> ammunition, whose directors feel that the time has come when it is both wise and necessary to take practical measures to preserve the remnant of American game. Already the activities of this organization cover a wide range, and it has been particularly active in enlisting support for the Weeks bill for the federal protection of migratory birds.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Wild Life Protective Association </span> came into existence in 1910, rather suddenly, for the purpose of promoting the cause of the Bayne no-sale-of-game bill, and other measures. It raised the fund that met the chief expenses of that campaign. Since that time it has taken an important part in three other hotly contested campaigns in other states, two of which were successful.
</p>
<p>
At the present moment, and throughout the future, these New York
organizations need <i> large sums of money </i> with which to meet
the legitimate expenses of active campaigns for great measures. They
need <i> some </i> money from outside the state of New York! <i> Too
much of the burden of national campaigning has been and is being
left to be borne by the people of New York City</i>. This policy is
growing monotonous. There is every reason why Chicago, St. Louis,
Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Boston should each year turn $100,000 into the hands of these
well-equipped and well managed national organizations whose officers
know <i> how to get results</i>, all over our country.
</p>
<p>
Such organizations as these do not exist in other cities; and this
is very unfortunate. New Orleans should be a center of protectionist
activity for the South, San Francisco for the Pacific slope, and
Chicago for the Middle West. Will they not become so?
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Two Independent Workers. </span> &mdash;At the western edge of the delta of the Mississippi there have arisen two men who loom up into prominence at an outpost of the Army of Defense which they themselves have established. For what they already have done in the creation of wild-fowl preserves in Louisiana, Edward A. McIlhenny and Charles Willis Ward deserve the thanks of the American People-at-large. An account of their splendid activities, and the practical results already secured, will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXVIII"> Chapter XXXVIII</a>, on "Private Game Preserves," and in the story of Marsh Island. Already the home of these gentlemen, Avery Island, Louisiana, has become an important center of activity in wild-life protection.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Line Of Action. </span> &mdash;In the face of a calamity, the saving of life and property and the check of fire and flood depends upon good judgment and quick action at the critical moment. In emergencies, the slow and academic method will not serve. It is the run, the jump, the short cut and the violent method that saves life. If a woman is drowning, the sensible man does not wait for an introduction to her; nor does he run to an acquaintance to borrow his boat, or stop to put on a collar and necktie. He seizes the first boat that he can find, and breaks its lock and chain if necessary; or, failing that, he plunges in without one. When he reaches the imperiled party, he doesn't say, "Will you kindly let me save you?" He seizes her by the hair, and tries to keep her head above water, without ceremony.
</p>
<p>
That is to-day the condition and the treatment necessary regarding
our remnant of wild life. We are compelled to act quickly, directly,
and even violently at times, if we save anything worth while.
</p>
<p>
There is <i> no time </i> to depend upon the academic "education" of
the public by the seductive illustrated lecture on birds, or the
article about the habits of mammals. Those methods are all well
enough in their places, but we must not depend upon them in
emergencies like the present, for they do not pass laws or arrest
lawbreakers. Give the public all of that material that you can
supply, and the more the better, but for heaven's sake <i> do not
</i> depend upon the spread of bird-lore "education" to stop the
work of the game-hogs! If you do, all the wild life will be
destroyed while the educational work is going on.
</p>
<p>
Often you can educate a gunner, and make him a protectionist; but
you never can do it by showing him pictures of birds. He needs
strong reasoning and exhortation, not bird-lore. To-day it is
necessary to employ the most direct, forceful and at times even rude
methods. Where slaughtering cannot be stopped by moral suasion, it
must be stopped with a hickory club. The thing to do is to <i> get
results, and get them quickly, before it is too late</i>!
</p>
<p>
If the business section of a town is burning down, no one goes into
the suburbs to lecture on architecture, or exhibit pictures of fire
apparatus. The rush is for water, fire-engines, red-blooded men and
dynamite. When the birds all around you are being shot to death by
poachers who fear not God nor regard man, and you need help to stop
it on the instant, run to your neighbor's house, and ring his bell.
If he fails to hear the bell, pound on his door until you jar the
whole house.
</p>
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page259] </span> </a>
<p>
When he comes down half-dressed, blinking and rubbing his eyes,
shout at him:
</p>
<p>
"Come out! Your birds are all being shot to pieces!"
</p>
<p>
"Are they?" he will say. "But what can <i> I </i> do about it? I
can't help it! I'm no game warden."
</p>
<p>
"Put on your clothes, get your shot-gun and come out and drive off
the killing gang."
</p>
<p>
"But what good will that do? They will come back again."
</p>
<p>
"Not if we do our duty. We must have them arrested, and appear
against them in court."
</p>
<p>
"But," says the sleepy citizen, "That won't do much good. The laws
are not strict enough; and besides, they are not well enforced, even
as they are!"
</p>
<p>
"Then let's make it our business to see that the present laws are
enforced, and go to our members of the legislature, and have them
pass some stronger laws."
</p>
<p>
And this brings me to a very important subject:
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p class="centerheading">
	How To Pass A New Law
</p>
<p>
We venture to say that the average citizen little realizes how
possible it is to secure the passage of a law that is clearly
necessary for the better protection of wild life and forests.
Because of this, and of the necessity for exact knowledge, I shall
here set down specific instructions on this subject.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Personal Equation. </span> &mdash;One determined man can secure the passage of a good law, provided he is reasonably intelligent and sufficiently determined. The man who starts a movement must make up his mind to follow it up, direct its fortunes, stay with it when the storms of opposition beat upon it, and never give up until it is signed by the governor. He must be willing to sacrifice his personal convenience, many of his pleasures, and work when his friends are asleep or pleasuring.
</p>
<p>
In working for the protection of wild life there is one mighty and
unfailing source of consolation. It is this:
</p>
<p>
<i> Your cause always gains in strength, and the cause of the
destroyers always loses strength! </i>
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Choice Of A Cause. </span> &mdash;Be broad-minded. Do not rush to the legislature with a demand for a law to permit the taking of bull-heads with June-bugs in the creeks of your township, or to give your county a specially early open season on quail in order that your boy may try his new gun before he goes back to college. <i> Don't propose any "local" legislation</i>; for in progressive states, local game legislation is coming strongly into disfavor,&mdash;just as it should! Legislate for your whole state, and nothing less.
</p>
<p>
Do not bother your legislature with a trivial bill. Choose a cause
that <a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page260] </span> </a> is worth while to grown men, and it shall be
well with you. It takes no more time to pass a large bill than a
small one; and big men prefer to be identified with big measures.
</p>
<p>
Before you have a bill drawn, advise with men whose opinions are
worth having. If the end you have in mind is a great and good one,
<i> go ahead</i>, whether you secure support in advance or not. If
the needs of the hour clearly demand the measure, <i> go ahead</i>,
even though you start absolutely alone. A good measure never goes
far without attracting company.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Drafting A Bill. </span> &mdash;As a rule, the members of a legislative body do not have time to draft bills on subjects that are new or strange to them. A short bill is easily prepared by your own representative; but a lengthy bill, covering a serious reform, is a different matter. Hire a lawyer to draft the bill for you. A really good lawyer will not charge much for drafting a bill that is to benefit the public, and grind no private axe; but if the bill is long, and requires long study, even the good citizen must charge something.
</p>
<p>
Your bill must fully recognize existing laws. It must be either
prohibitory or permissive; which means that it can say what shall
not be done, or else that which may be done according to law, all
other acts being forbidden. Your lawyer must decide which form is
best. For my part, I greatly prefer the prohibitive form, as being
the stronger and more impressive of the two. I think it is the
province of the law <i> to forbid </i> the destruction of wild life
and forests, under penalties.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Penalties. </span> &mdash;Every law should provide a penalty for its infringement; but the penalty should not be out of all proportion to the offense. It is just as unwise to impose a fine of one dollar for killing song-birds for food as it is to provide for a fine of three hundred dollars. A fine that is too small fails to impress the prisoner, and it begets contempt for the law and the courts! A fine that is altogether too high is apt to be set aside by the court as "excessive." In my opinion, the best fines for wild life slaughter would be as follows:

<p>
For killing a man "by mistake," the fine should be $500, payable in
five annual instalments, to the court, for the family of the victim.
</p>
<p>
Whenever fines are not paid, the convicted party should be sentenced
to imprisonment at hard labor at the rate of one-half day for each
dollar <a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page261] </span> </a> of the fine imposed; and a sentence at hard
labor should be the <i> first option of the court</i>! Many a rich
and reckless poacher snaps his fingers at fines; but a sentence to
hard labor would strike terror to the heart of the most brazen of
them. To all such men, "labor" is the twin terror to "death."
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Introduction Of A Bill. </span> &mdash;Much wisdom is called for in the selection of legislative champions for wild-life bills. It is possible to state here only the leading principles involved.
</p>
<p>
Of course it is best to look for an introducer within the political
party that is in the majority. A man who has many important bills on
his hands is bound to give his best attention to his own pet
measures; and it is best to choose a man who is not already
overloaded. If a man has a host of enemies, pass him by. By all
means choose a man whose high character and good name will be a
tower of strength to your cause; and if necessary, <i> wait for him
to make up his mind</i>. Mr. Lawrence W. Trowbridge waited three
long and anxious weeks in the hope that Hon. George A. Blauvelt
would finally consent to champion the Bayne bill in the New York
Assembly. At last Mr. Blauvelt consented to take it up; and the time
spent in waiting for his decision was a grand investment! He was the
Man of all men to pilot that bill through the Assembly.
</p>
<p>
Very often the "quiet man" of a legislative body is a good man to
champion a new and drastic measure. The quiet man who makes up his
mind to take hold of "a hard bill to pass" often astonishes the
natives by his ability to get results. Representative John F. Lacey,
of Iowa, made his name a household word all over the United States
by the quiet, steady, tireless and finally resistless energy with
which for three long years in Congress he worked for "the Lacey bird
bill." For years his colleagues laughed at him, and cheerfully voted
down his bill. But he persisted. His cause steadily gained in
strength; and his final triumph laid the axe at the root of a
thousand crimes against wild life, throughout the length and breadth
of this land. He rendered the people of America a service that
entitles him to our everlasting gratitude and remembrance.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> After The Introduction Of A Bill. </span> &mdash;As soon as a bill is introduced it is referred to a committee, to be examined and reported upon. If there is opposition,&mdash;and to every bill that really does something worth while there always is opposition,&mdash;then there is a "hearing." The committee appoints a day, when the friends and foes of the bill assemble, and express their views.
</p>
<p>
The week preceding a hearing is your busy week. You must plan your
campaign, down to the smallest details. Pick the men whom you wish
to have speak (for ten minutes each) on the various parts of your
bill, and divide the topics and the time between them. Call upon the
friends of the bill in various portions of the state to attend and
"say something." Go up with a strong body of fine men. <i> Have as
many organizations represented as you possibly can</i>! The
"organizations" represent the great mass of people, and the voters
also.
</p>
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page262] </span> </a>
<p>
When you reach the hearing, hand to your bill's champion, who will
be floor manager for your side, a clear and concise list of your
speakers, carefully arranged and stating who's who. That being done,
you have only to fill your own ten minutes and afterward enjoy the
occasion.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Value Of Accuracy. </span> &mdash;It is unnecessary to say, in working for a bill,&mdash;<i>always be sure of your facts</i>. Never let your opponents catch you tripping in accuracy of statement. If you make one serious error, your enemies will turn it against you to the utmost. Better understate facts than overstate them. This shrewd old world quickly recognizes the careful, conservative man whose testimony is so true and so rock-founded that no assaults can shake it. Legislators are quick to rely on the words and opinions of the man who can safely be trusted. If your enemies try to overwhelm you with extravagant statements, that are unfair to your cause, the chances are that the men who judge between you will recognize them by their ear-marks, and discount them accordingly.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Work With Members. </span> &mdash;Sometimes a subject that is put before a legislative body is so new, and the thing proposed is so drastic, it becomes necessary to take measures to place a great many facts before each member of the body. Under such circumstances the member naturally desires to be "shown." The cleanest and finest campaigning for a reform measure is that in which both sides deal with facts, rather than with personal importunities. With a good cause in hand, it is a pleasure to prepare concise statements of facts and conditions from which a legislator may draw logical conclusions. Whenever a bill can be won through in that way, game protection work becomes a delight.
</p>
<p>
In all important new measures affecting the rights and the property
of the whole people of a state, the conscientious legislator wishes
to know how the people feel about it. When you tell him that "The
wild life belongs to the whole people of the state; and this bill is
in their interest," he needs to know for certain that your
proposition is true. Sometimes there is only one way in which he can
be fully convinced; and that is by the people of his district.
</p>
<p>
Then it becomes necessary to send out a general alarm, and call upon
the People to write to their representatives and express <i> their
</i> views. Give them, in printed matter, the <i> latest facts </i>
in the case, forecast the future as you think it should be forecast,
then demand that the men and women who are interested do write to
their senators and assemblyman, and express <i> their </i> views, in
<i> their own way! </i> Let there be no "machine letters" sent out,
all ready for signature; for such letters are a waste of effort, and
belong in the waste baskets to which they are quickly consigned. The
members of legislative bodies hate them, and rightly, too. They want
to hear from men who can think for themselves, give reasons of their
own, and express their desires in their own way.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Press And The Newspapers. </span> &mdash;It is impossible to overestimate the influence of the newspapers and the periodical press in general, in the protection of wild life. But for their sympathy, their support and their independent assaults upon the Army of Destruction, our game species <a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page263] </span> </a> would nearly all of them have been annihilated, long ago. Editors are sympathetic and responsive good-citizens, as keenly sensitive regarding their duties as any of the rest of us are, and from the earliest times of protection they have been on the firing line, helping to beat back the destroyers. It is indeed a rare sight to see an editor giving aid, comfort or advice to the enemy. I can not recall more than a score of articles that I have seen or heard of during thirty years in this field that opposed the cause of wild life protection. <a name="FNanchorK" id="FNanchorK"> </a> <a class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_K"> [K] </a> At this moment, for instance, I bear in particularly grateful remembrance the active campaign work of the following newspapers:

In campaigning, always appeal for the help of the newspapers. If
there are no private axes to grind, they help generously. The weekly
journals are of value, but the monthlies are printed so long in
advance of their dates of issue that they seldom move fast enough to
keep abreast of the procession. Their mechanical limitations are
many and serious.
</p>
<p>
Every newspaper likes "exclusive" news, letters and articles. On
that basis they will print about all the live matter that you can
furnish. But at the same time, the important news of the campaign
<i> must </i> be sent to the press broadcast, in the form of printed
slips all ready for the foreman. Many of these are never used, but
the others are; and it pays. The news in every slip must be vouched
for by the sender, or it will not be used. Often it will appear as a
letter signed by the sender; which is all right, only the news is
most effective when printed without a signature. Do not count on the
Associated Press; because its peculiar demands render it almost
impossible for it to be utilized in game protection work.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> How To Meet Opposition. </span> &mdash;There is no rule for the handling of opposition <a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page264] </span> </a> that is fair and open. For opposition that is unfair and under-handed, there is one powerful weapon,&mdash;Publicity. The American people love fair play, and there is nothing so fatal to an unfair fighter as a searchlight, turned full on him without fear and without mercy. If it is reliably and persistently reported that some citizen who ought to be on the right side has for some dark reason become active on the wrong side, print the reports in a large newspaper, and ask him publicly if they are true. If the reports are false, he can quickly come out in a letter and say so, and end the matter. If they are true, the public will soon know it, and act accordingly.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Eternal Vigilance. </span> &mdash;The progress of a bill must be watched by some competent person from day to day, and finally from hour to hour. I know one bill that was saved from defeat only because its promoter dragged it, almost by force, out of the hands of a tardy clerk, and accompanied it in person to the senate, where it was passed in the last hour of a session.
</p>
<p>
A bill should not be left to a long slumber in the drawer of a
committee. Such delays nearly always are dangerous.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Signing The Bill. </span> &mdash;The promoter of a great measure always seeks the sympathy of the Chief Executive early in the day; but he should not make the diplomatic error of trying to exact promises or pledges in advance. Good judges do not give away their decisions in advance.
</p>
<p>
Because a Chief Executive remarks after a bill has been sent to him
for signing that he "cannot approve it," it is no reason to give up
in despair. Many an executive approval has been snatched at the last
moment, as a brand from the burning. <i> Ask for a hearing before
the bill is acted upon</i>. At the hearing, and before it and after,
the People who wish the bill to become a law must express
themselves,&mdash;by letter, by telegram, and by appeal in person.
If the governor becomes convinced that an <i> overwhelming majority
</i> of his people desire him to sign the bill, <i> he will sign
it</i>, even though personally he is opposed to it! The hall mark of
a good governor is a spirit of obedience to the will of the great
majority.
</p>
<p>
Not until your bill has been signed by the governor are you ready to
go home with a quiet mind, take off your armor, and put your ear to
the telephone while you hear some one say as your only
reward,&mdash;"Well done, good and faithful servant."
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> As To "Credit." </span> &mdash;Do not count upon receiving any credit for what you do in the cause of game protection, outside the narrow circle of your own family and your nearest friends. This is a busy world; and the human mind flits like a restless bird from one subject to another. The men who win campaigns are forgotten by the general public, in a few hours! There is nothing more fickle or more fleeting than the bubble called "popular applause." Judging by the experiences of great men, I should say that it has no substance, whatever. The most valuable reward of the man who fights in a great cause, and helps to win victories, is the profound satisfaction that comes to every good citizen who bravely does his whole duty, and leaves the world better than he found it, without the slightest thought of gallery applause.

		NEW LAWS NEEDED: A ROLL-CALL OF THE STATES
	</div>
</div>
<p>
The principles of wild-life protection and encouragement are now so
firmly established as to leave little room for argument regarding
their value. When they are set forth before the people of any given
state, the only question is of willingness to do the right thing; of
duty or a defiance of duty; of good citizenship or the reign of
selfishness. Men who do not wish to do their duty purposely befog
great issues by noisy talk and tiresome academic discussions of
trivial details; and such men are the curse and scourge of reform
movements.
</p>
<p>
There are a very few persons who foolishly assert that "there are
too many game laws!" It is entirely wrong for any person to make
such a statement, for it tends to promote harmful error. The fact
that our laws are <i> too lenient</i>, or are not fully enforced, is
no excuse for denouncing their purposes. We have all along been too
timid, too self indulgent, and too much afraid of hurting the
feelings of the game-hogs.
</p>
<p>
Give me the power to make the game laws of any state or province and
I will guarantee to save the <i> non-migratory </i> wild life of
that region. I will not only make adequate laws, but I will also
provide means, men and penalties by which <i> they will be
enforced</i>! It is easy and simple, for men who are not afraid.
</p>
<p>
I have been at considerable pains to analyze the game laws of each
state, ascertain their shortcomings, and give a list of the faults
that need correction by new legislation. It has required no profound
wisdom to do this, because the principles involved are so plain that
any intelligent schoolboy fifteen years old can master them in one
hour. I have performed this task hopefully, in the belief that in
many states the real issues have not been plainly put before the
people. Hereafter no state shall destroy its wild life through
ignorance of the laws that would preserve it.
</p>
<p>
Let no man say that "it is too late to save the wild life"; for
excepting the dead-and-gone species, that is not true. Let no man
say that "we can not save the wild life by law"; for that is not
true, either. As long as laws are lax, even law-abiding people will
take advantage of them.
</p>
<p>
There are millions of men who think it is <i> right to kill all the
game that the law allows</i>! There are thousands of women who think
it is right to wear aigrettes as long as the law permits their sale!
And yet, if we are resolute and diligent there is plenty of hope for
the future. During the past three years, to go no farther back, we
have seen the whole state of New York swept clean of the traffic in
native wild game by the <a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page266] </span> </a> Bayne law, and of the
traffic in wild birds' plumage on women's hats through the Dutcher
law. To-day, in this state, we find ninety-nine women out of every
one hundred wearing flowers, and laces, and plush and satin on their
hats, instead of the heads, bodies and feathers of wild birds that
were the regular thing until three years ago. The change has been a
powerful commentary on the value of good laws for the protection of
wild life. The Dutcher law has caused the plumage of wild birds <i>
almost wholly to disappear from the State of New York</i>!
</p>
<p>
We shall here point out the plain duty of each state; and then it
will be up to them, individually, to decide whether they can stand
the blood-test or not.
</p>
<p>
A state or a nation can be ungentlemanly, unfair or mean, just the
same as an individual. No state has a right to maintain shambles for
the slaughter of migratory game or song birds that belong in part to
sister states. <i> Every state holds its migratory bird life in
trust, for the benefit of the people of the nation at large</i>. A
state is just as responsible for its treatment of wild life as any
individual; and it is time to open books of account.
</p>
<p>
It is robbery, as well as murder, for any southern state to
slaughter the robins of the northern states, where no robins may be
killed. <i> No southern gentleman can permit such doings, after the
crime has been pointed out to him</i>! In the North, the men who are
caught shooting robins are instantly haled to court, and fined or
imprisoned. If we of the North should kill for food the mockingbirds
that visit us, the people of the South instantly would brand us as
monsters of greed and meanness; and they would be perfectly
justified in so doing.
</p>
<p>
Let us at least be honest in "agreeing upon a state of fact," as the
lawyers say, whether we act sensibly and mercifully or not. Just so
long as there remains in this land of ours a fauna of game birds,
and the gunners of one-half the states are allowed to dictate the
laws for the slaughter of it, just so long will our present
protection remain utterly absurd and criminally inadequate. Look at
these absurdities:
</p>
<p>
New York, New Jersey and many other northern states rigidly prohibit
the late winter and spring shooting of waterfowl and shore birds,
and limit the bag; North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and
other southern states not only slaughter wild fowl and shore birds
all winter and spring, without limit, but several of them kill
certain non-game birds besides!
</p>
<p>
All the northern states protect the robin, for the good that it
does; but in North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and
some other southern states, thousands of robins are shot for food.
Minnesota has stopped spring shooting; but her sister state on the
south, Iowa, obstinately refuses to do so.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The United States At Large. </span> &mdash;There are two great measures that should be carried into effect by the governing body of the United States. One is the enactment of a law providing federal protection for all migratory <a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page267] </span> </a> birds; and Canada and Mexico should be induced to join with the United States <i> in an international treaty to that effect</i>.
</p>
<p>
The other necessary measure is the passage of a joint resolution of
Congress <i> declaring every national forest and forest reserve also
a game preserve and general sanctuary for wild life</i>, in which
there shall be no hunting or killing of wild creatures of any kind
save predatory animals.
</p>
<p>
The tendency of the times,&mdash;and the universal slaughter of wild
life on this continent,&mdash;point straight as an arrow flies in
that direction. Soon or late, we have GOT to come to it! If Congress
does not take the initiatory steps, <i> the People will</i>! Such a
consummation is necessary; it is justified by common sense and the
inexorable logic of the situation, and when done it will be right.
</p>
<p>
The time was when the friends of wild life did not dare speak of
this subject in Washington save in whispers. That was in the days
when the Appalachian Park bill could not be passed, and when there
were angry mutterings and even curses leveled against Gifford
Pinchot and the Forestry Bureau because so many national forests
were being set aside. That was in the days when a few western
sheep-men thought that they owned the whole Rocky Mountains without
having bought them. To-day, the American people have grown
accustomed to the idea of having the resources of the public domain
saved and conserved for the benefit of the millions rather than
lavished upon a favored few. To-day it is perfectly safe to talk
about making every national forest a first class wild-life
sanctuary, and it is up to the People to request Congress to take
that action, at once.
</p>
<p>
The Weeks bill, the Anthony bill, and the McLean bill now before
Congress to provide federal protection for migratory birds are
practically identical. All three are good bills; and it matters not
which one finally becomes a law. Whichever is put forward finally
for passage should provide federal protection for <i> all </i>
migratory birds that ever enter the United States, Alaska, or Porto
Rico. Why favor the duck and leave the robin to its fate, or vice
versa? It will be just as easy to do this task by wholes as by
halves. The time to hesitate, to feel timid, or to be afraid of the
other fellow has gone by. To-day the millions of honest and
serious-minded Americans are ready to back the most thorough and
most drastic policy, because that has become the most necessary and
the best policy. Furthermore, it is the only policy worthy of
serious consideration.
</p>
<p>
Some of our states have done rather well in wild-life
protection,&mdash;considering the absurdity of our national policy
as a whole; others have done indifferently, and some have been and
still are very remiss. Here is where we intend to hew to the line,
and without fear or favor set forth the standing of each state
according to its merits or its lack of merits. In a life-or-death
matter such as now confronts us regarding the wild life of our
country, it is time to speak plainly.
</p>
<p>
In the following call of the States, the glaring deficiencies in
state game laws will be set forth in detail, in order that the sore
spots may <a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page268] </span> </a> be exposed to the view of the doctors.
Conditions will be represented <i> as they exist at the end of the
summer of 1912</i>, and it is to be hoped that these faults soon may
be corrected.

<p class="centerheading">
	A Roll-Call Of The States
</p>
<div class="statelist">
	<span class="name"> Alabama: </span>
	<p>
It is a satisfaction to be able to open this list with the name of a
state that is entitled to a medal of honor for game protection. In
this particular field of progress and enlightenment, the state of
Alabama is the pioneer state of the South. New York now occupies a
similar position in the North; but New York is an older state, and
stronger in her general love of nature. The attainment of advanced
protection in any southern state is a very different matter from
what it is in the North.
	</p>
	<p>
Five years ago Alabama set her house in order. The slaughter of song
and insectivorous birds has been so far stopped as any Southern
state can stop it unaided by the federal government, and those birds
are recognized and treated as the farmers' best friends. The absurd
system of attempted protection through county laws has been
abandoned. The sale of game has been stopped, and since that
stoppage, quail have increased. The trapping and export of game have
ceased, and wild turkeys and woodcock are now increasing. It is
unlawful to kill or capture non-game birds. Bag limits have been
imposed, but <i> the bag limit laws are all too liberal, and should
be reduced</i>. A hunter's license law is in force, and the
department of game and fish is self-supporting. Night hunting is
prohibited, and female deer may not be killed. A comprehensive
warden system has been provided. As yet, however, Alabama
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Permits the shooting of waterfowl to March 15, which is too late, by one and one-half months.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be suppressed.
		</li>
		<li>
			There should be a limit of two deer per year, and killing should be
		</li>
		<li>
			restricted to deer with horns not less than three inches long.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
The story of game protection in Alabama began in 1907. Prior to that
time, the slaughter of wild life was very great. It is known that
enormous numbers of quail were annually killed by negro farm hands,
who hunted at least three days each week, regardless of work to be
done. The slaughter of quail, wild ducks, woodcock, doves, robins
and snipe was described as "nauseating."
	</p>
	<p>
The change that has been wrought since 1907 is chiefly due to the
efforts of one man. Alabama owes her standing to-day to the
admirable qualities of John H. Wallace, Jr., her Game and Fish
Commissioner, author of the State's policy in wild-life
conservation. His broad-mindedness, his judgment and his success
make him a living object lesson of the power of one determined man
in the conservation of wild life.
	</p>
	<p>
Commissioner Wallace is an ardent supporter of the Weeks and Anthony
bills for federal protection, and as a lawyer of the South, he
believes there is "no constitutional inhibition against federal
legislation for the protection of birds of passage."
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Alaska: </span> <a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page269] </span> </a>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The sale of game must be absolutely prohibited, forever.
		</li>
		<li>
			The slaughter of big game by Indians, miners and prospectors should now be limited, and strictly regulated by law, on rational lines.
		</li>
		<li>
			The slaughter of walrus for ivory and hides, both in the Alaskan and Russian waters of Bering Sea, should be totally prohibited for ten years.
		</li>
		<li>
			The game-warden service should be quadrupled in number of wardens, and in general effectiveness.
		</li>
		<li>
			The game-warden service should be supplied with two sea-going vessels, independent for patrol work.
		</li>
		<li>
			The bag limit on hoofed game is 50% too large.
		</li>
		<li>
			To accomplish these ends, Congress should annually appropriate $50,000 for the protection of wild life in Alaska. The present amount, $15,000, is very inadequate, and the great wild-life interests at stake amply justify the larger amount.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It is now time for Alaska to make substantial advances in the
protection of her wild life. It is no longer right nor just for
Indians, miners and prospectors to be permitted by law to kill all
the big game they please, whenever they please. The indolent and
often extortionate Indians of Alaska,&mdash;who now demand "big
money" for every service they perform,&mdash;are not so valuable as
citizens that they should be permitted to feed riotously upon <i>
moose, and cow moose at that</i>, until that species is
exterminated. Miners and prospectors are valuable citizens, but that
is no reason why they should forever be allowed to live upon wild
game, any more than that hungry prospectors in our Rocky Mountains
should be allowed to kill cattle.
	</p>
	<p>
Alaska and its resources do not belong to the very few people from
"the States" who have gone there to make their fortunes and get out
again as quickly as possible. The quicker the public mind north of
Wrangel is disabused of that idea, the better. Its game belongs to
the people of this nation of ninety-odd millions, and it is a safe
prediction that the ninety millions will not continue to be willing
that the miners, prospectors and Indians shall continue to live on
moose meat and caribou tongues in order to save bacon and beef.
	</p>
	<p>
Mr. Frank E. Kleinschmidt said to me that at Sand Point, Alaska, he
saw eighty-two caribou tongues brought in by an Indian, and sold at
fifty cents each, while (according to all accounts) most of the
bodies of the slaughtered animals became a loss.
	</p>
	<p>
Governor Clark has recommended in his annual report for 1911 that
the protection now enjoyed by the giant brown bear <i> (Ursus
middendorffi</i>) on Kadiak Island be removed, for the benefit of
settlers <i> and their stock</i>! It goes without saying that no one
proposes that predatory wild animals shall be permitted to retard
the development of any wild country that is required by civilized
man. All we ask in this matter is that, as in the case of the
once-proposed slaughter of sea-lions on the Pacific Coast, <i> the
necessity of the proposed slaughter shall be fully and adequately
proven before the killing begins</i>! It is fair to insist that the
sea-lion episode shall not be repeated on Kadiak Island.
	</p>
	<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page270] </span> </a>
	<p>
The big game of Alaska can not long endure against a "limit" of two
moose, three mountain sheep, three caribou and six deer per year,
per man. At that rate the moose and sheep soon will disappear. The
limit should be one moose, two sheep, two caribou and four
deer,&mdash;unless we are willing to dedicate the Alaskan big game
to Commercialism. No sportsman needs a larger bag than the revised
schedule; and commercialists should not be allowed to kill big game
anywhere, at any time.
	</p>
	<p>
Let us bear in mind the fact that Alaska is being throughly "opened
up" to the Man with a Gun. Here is the latest evidence, from the new
circular of an outfitter:
	</p>
	<p>
"I will have plenty of good horses, and good, competent and
courteous guides; also other camp attendants if desired. My
intention is to establish permanently at that point, as I believe it
is the gateway to the finest <i> and about the last </i> of the
great game countries of North America."
	</p>
	<p>
The road is open; the pack-train is ready; the guides are waiting.
Go on and slay the Remnant!
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Arizona: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The band-tailed pigeons and all non-game birds should immediately be given protection; and a salaried warden system should be established under a Commissioner whose term is not less than four years.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of automatic and pump guns, in hunting, should be prohibited.
		</li>
		<li>
			Spring shooting should be prohibited.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Arizona has good reason to be proud of her up-to-date position in
the ranks of the best game-protecting states. No other state or
territory of her age ever has made so good a showing of protective
laws. The enactment of laws to cover the points mentioned above
would leave little to be desired in Arizona. That state has a bird
fauna well worth protecting, and game wardens are extremely
necessary.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Arkansas: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The enforcement of game laws should be placed in charge of a salaried commissioner.
		</li>
		<li>
			Spring shooting of wildfowl should be stopped at once.
		</li>
		<li>
			A reasonable close season should be provided for water fowl, and swans should be protected throughout the year.
		</li>
		<li>
			A bag-limit law should be enacted.
		</li>
		<li>
			A force of game wardens, salaried and unsalaried, should at once be created.
		</li>
		<li>
			The killing of female deer and the hounding of deer, should be stopped.
		</li>
		<li>
			No buck deer should be shot, unless horns three inches long are seen before firing.
		</li>
		<li>
			A hunter's license law is necessary; and the fees should go to the support of the game protection department.
		</li>
		<li>
			The local exemptions in favor of market hunters in Mississippi county should be repealed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It appears that in Arkansas the laws for the protection and increase
of wild life are by no means up to the mark. At this moment,
Arkansas is next to Florida, the rearmost of all our states in
wild-life protection. <a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page271] </span> </a> Awake, Arkansas! Consider
the peril that threatens your fauna. The Sunk Lands, in your
northeastern corner along the St. Francis River, are the greatest
wild-fowl refuge anywhere in the Mississippi Valley between the Gulf
Coast of Louisiana and the breeding-grounds of Minnesota. A duty to
the nation devolves upon you, to protect the migratory waterfowl
that visit your great bird refuge from the automatic and pump guns
of the pothunters who shoot for northern markets, and kill all that
they can kill. <i> Protect those Sunken Lands</i>! Confer a boon on
all the people of the Mississippi Valley by making that region a
bird refuge in fact as well as in name.
	</p>
	<p>
Heretofore, you have permitted hired market gunners from outside
your borders to slaughter the wild-fowl of your Sunk Lands literally
by millions, and ship them to northern markets, with very little
benefit to your people. It is time for that slaughter to cease.
Don't maintain a duck and goose shambles in Mississippi County, year
after year, as North Carolina does! Do unto other states as you
would have other states do unto you. <i> Do not </i> be afraid to
pass nine good laws in one act. Clear your record in the Family of
States, and save your fauna before it is too late. It is not fair
for you to permit the slaughter of the insectivorous birds that are
like the blood of life to the farmer and fruit grower.

As game laws are generally regarded, California has on her books a
series that look rather good to the eye, but which are capable of
considerable improvement. All along the line, the birds and
quadrupeds of the Golden State are vanishing! Under that heading, a
vigorous chapter could be written; but space forbids its development
here. Just fancy laws that permit gunning and hunting with dogs,
from August until January&mdash;one-half the entire year! Think of
the nesting birds that are disturbed or killed by dogs and gunners
after other birds!
	</p>
	<p>
California's wild ducks and geese have been slaughtered to an extent
almost beyond belief. The splendid sage grouse and the sharp-tailed
grouse are greatly reduced in numbers. Of her hundreds of thousands
of antelope, once the cheapest game in the market, scarcely "a
trace" remains. Her mountain sheep and mule deer are almost extinct.
Her grizzly bears are gone!
	</p>
	<p>
The most terrible slaughter ever recorded for automatic guns
occurred <a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page272] </span> </a> in Glenn County, Cal., on Feb. 5, 1906, when
two men (whose story was published in <i> Outdoor Life</i>, xvii, p.
371, April, 1906), killed 450 geese in one day, and actually bagged
218 of them in <i> one hour</i>!
	</p>
	<p>
Every person who has paid attention to game protection on the
Pacific coast well knows that during the past eight years or more,
the work of game protection in California has been in a state of
frequent turmoil. At times the lack of harmony between the State
Fish and Game Commission and the sportsmen of the state has been
damaging to the interests of wild life, and deplorable. In the case
of Warden Welch, in Santa Cruz County, pernicious politics came near
robbing the state of a splendid warden, but the courts finally
overthrew the overthrowers of Mr. Welch, and reinstated him.
	</p>
	<p>
The fish and game commissioners of any state should be broad-minded,
non-partisan, strictly honest and sincere. So long as they possess
these qualities, they deserve and should have the earnest and
aggressive support of all sportsmen and all lovers of wild life. The
remnant of wild life is entitled to a square deal, and harmony in
the camp of its friends. Fortunately California has an excellent
force of salaried game wardens (82 in all) and 577 volunteer wardens
serving without salary.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Colorado: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The State of Colorado should instantly stop the sale of native wild game to be used as food.
		</li>
		<li>
			It should stop all late winter and spring shooting of native wild birds.
		</li>
		<li>
			It should give the sage grouse, pinnated grouse and all shore birds a ten year close season, remove the dove from the list of game birds, and give it a permanent close season.
		</li>
		<li>
			It should remove the crane and the swan from the list of game birds.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
In twenty-five short years we have seen in Colorado a waste of wild
life and the destruction of a living inheritance that has few
parallels in history. Possibly the people of Colorado are satisfied
with the residuum; but some outsiders regard all Rocky Mountain
shambles with a feeling of horror.
	</p>
	<p>
A brief quarter-century ago, Colorado was a zoological park of grand
scenery and big game. The scenery remains, but of the great wild
herds, only samples are left, and of some species not even that.
	</p>
	<p>
The last bison of Colorado were exterminated in Lost Park by
scoundrels calling themselves "taxidermists," in 1897. Of the
200,000 mule deer that inhabited Routt County and other portions of
Colorado, not enough now remain to make deer hunting interesting. A
perpetual close season was put on mountain sheep just in time to
save a dozen small flocks as seed stock. Those flocks have been
permitted to live, and they have bred until now there are perhaps
3,500 sheep in the state. Of elk, only a remnant is left, now
protected for fifteen years.

The grizzly bear is so thoroughly gone that one is seen only by a
rare accident; but black bears and pumas are sufficiently numerous
to afford fair sport, provided the hunter has a fine outfit of dogs,
horses and <a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page273] </span> </a> guides. Of prong-horned antelope, several
bands remain, but it is reported that they are steadily diminishing.
The herds and herders of domestic sheep are blamed for the decrease,
and I have no doubt they deserve it. The sheep and their champions
are the implacable enemies of all wild game, and before them the
game vanishes, everywhere.
	</p>
	<p>
The lawmakers of Colorado have tried hard to provide adequate
statutes for the protection of the wild life of the state. In fact,
I think that no state has put forth greater or more elaborate
efforts in that direction. For example, in 1899, under the
leadership of Judge D.C. Beaman of Denver, Colorado initiated the
"more game movement," by enacting a very elaborate law providing for
the establishment of private game preserves and farms for the
breeding of game under state license, and the tagging and sale of
preserve-bred game under state supervision.
	</p>
	<p>
The history of game destruction in Colorado is a repetition of the
old, old story,&mdash;plenty of laws, but a hundred times too many
hunters, killing the game both according to law and contrary to it,
and doing it five times as fast as the game could breed. That
combination can safely be warranted to wipe out the wild life of any
country in the world, and accomplish it right swiftly.
	</p>
	<p>
As a big-game country, Colorado is distinctly out of the running.
Her people are too lawless, and her frontiersmen are, in the main,
far too selfish to look upon plenteous game without going after it.
Some of these days, a new call of the wild will arise in Colorado,
demanding an open season on mountain sheep. Those who demand it will
say, "What harm will it do to kill a few surplus bucks? It will
improve the breed, and make the herds increase faster!"
	</p>
	<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page274] </span> </a>
	<p>
By all means, have an "open season" on the Colorado big-horn and the
British Columbia elk. It will "do them good." The excitement of ram
slaughter will be good for the females, will it not? Of course, they
will breed faster after that,&mdash;with all the big rams dead. Any
"surplus" wild life is a public nuisance, and should promptly be
shot to pieces.
	</p>
	<p>
In Colorado there is some desire that Estes Park should be acquired
as a national park, and maintained by the government; but the strong
reasons for this have not yet appeared. As yet we have not heard any
reason why the State of Colorado should not herself take it and make
of it a state park and game preserve. If done, it could be offered
as a partial atonement for her wastefulness in throwing away her
inheritance of grand game.
	</p>
	<p>
Colorado has work to do in the preservation of her remnant of bird
life. In several respects she is behind the times. The present is no
time to hesitate, or to ask the gunners what <i> they </i> wish to
have done about new laws for the saving of the remnant of game. The
dictates of common sense are plain, and inexorable. Let the
lawmakers do their whole duty by the remnant of wild life, whether
the game killers like it or not.
	</p>
	<p>
<i> The Curse of Domestic Sheep Upon Game and Cattle</i>.&mdash;Much
has been said in print and out of print regarding the extent to
which domestic sheep have destroyed the cattle ranges and
incidentally many game ranges of the West; but the half hath not
been told. The American people as a whole do not realize that the
domestic sheep has driven the domestic steer from the free grass of
the wild West, with the same speed and thoroughness with which the
buffalo-hunters of the 70's and 80's swept away the bison. I have
seen hundreds of thousands of acres of what once were beautiful and
fertile cattle-grazing lands in Montana, that has been left by
grazing sheep herds looking precisely as if the ground had been
shaven with razors and then sandpapered. The sheep have driven out
the cattle, and the price of beef has gone up accordingly. Neither
cattle, horses nor wild game can find food on ground that has been
grazed over by sheep.
	</p>
	<p>
The following is the testimony of a reliable eye witness, Mr. Dillon
Wallace, and the full text appears in his book, "<i>Saddle and Camp
in the Rockies</i>," (page 169):&mdash;
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
Domestic sheep and sheep herders are the greatest enemies of the
antelope, as well as of other game animals and birds in the regions
where herders take their flocks. The ranges over which domestic
sheep pasture are denuded of forage and stripped of all growth, and
antelope will not remain upon a range where sheep have been.
		</p>
		<p>
Thus the sheep, sweeping clean all before them and leaving the
ranges over which they pass unproductive, for several succeeding
seasons, of pasturage for either wild or domestic animals, together
with the destructive shepherds, are the worst enemies at present of
Utah's wild game, particularly of antelope, sage hens, and grouse.
		</p>
		<p>
In Iron county, which has already become an extensive sheep region,
settlers tell us that before the advent of sheep, grass grew so
luxuriously that a yearling calf lying in it could not be seen. Not
only has the grass here been eaten, but the roots tramped out and
killed by the hoofs of thousands upon thousands of sheep, and now
wide areas, where not long since grass was so plentiful, are as bare
and desolate as sand-piles.

	<span class="name"> Connecticut: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The sale of all native wild game, regardless of its source, should be prohibited at all times. Enact at once a five-year close season law on the remnant of ruffed grouse, quail, woodcock, snipe, and all shore birds.
		</li>
		<li>

		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Like so many other states, Connecticut has recklessly wasted her
wild-life inheritance. During the fifteen years preceding the year
1898, the bird life of that state had decreased 75 per cent. On
March 6, 1912, Senator Geo. P. McLean, of Connecticut stated at the
hearing held by his Committee on Forest Reservations and the
Protection of Game this fact: "We have more cover than there was
thirty or forty years ago, more brush probably, but there is not one
partridge [ruffed grouse] today where there were twenty ten years
ago!"
	</p>
	<p>
First of all, Connecticut needs a ten-year close season law to save
her remnant of shore birds before it is completely annihilated. Then
she needs a Bayne law, and needs it badly. Under such a law, and the
tagging system that it provides, the state game wardens would have
so strong a grip on the situation that the present unlawful sale of
game would be completely stopped. Half-way measures in preventing
the sale of game will not answer. Already Connecticut has wasted
thousands of dollars in fruitless efforts to restock her desolated
woodlands and farms with quail, and to introduce the Hungarian
partridge; but even yet she <i> will not </i> protect her own native
species!
	</p>
	<p>
Men of Connecticut, save the last remnants of your native game birds
before they are all utterly exterminated within your borders! Don't
ask the killers of game what <i> they </i> will agree to, but make
the laws what <i> you know </i> they should be! If you want a
gameless state, let the destruction go on as it now is going, with
<i> 16,000 licensed gunners </i> in the field each year, and you
will surely have it, right soon.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Delaware: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Stop all spring shooting, at once; stop killing shore birds for ten years, and protect swans indefinitely. <a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page276]</span> </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Enact bag-limit laws, in very small figures.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stop the sale of all native wild game, regardless of its use, by enacting a Bayne law.

	<p>
The state of Delaware is nearly twenty years behind the times. Can
it be possible that her Governor and her people are really satisfied
with that position? We think not. I dare say they are afflicted with
apathy, and game-hogs. The latter can easily back up General Apathy
to an extent that spells "no game laws." In one act, and at one bold
stroke, Delaware can step out of her position at the rear of the
procession of states, and take a place in the front rank. Will she
do it? We hope so, for her present status is unworthy of any
right-minded, red-blooded state this side of the Philippines.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> District Of Columbia: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The sale of all native wild game, regardless of its source, should be stopped immediately, by the enactment of a complete Bayne law.
		</li>
		<li>
			If game-shooting within the District is continued, on the marshes of the Eastern Branch and on the Potomac River, common decency demands the enactment of bag-limit laws and long close-season laws of the most modern pattern.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Just why it is that gross abuses against wild life have so long been
tolerated in the territorial center of the American nation, remains
to be ascertained. But, whatever the reason the situation is absurd
and intolerable, and Congress should terminate it immediately. As
late as 1897, and I think for two or three years thereafter,
thousands of <i> robins </i> were sold every year in the public
markets of Washington as food! As a spectacle for gods and men,
behold to-day the sale of quail, ruffed grouse, wild turkeys and
other American game, half way between the Capitol and the White
House! Look at Center Market as a national "fence" for the sale of
game stolen by market gunners from Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas
and Pennsylvania.
	</p>
	<p>
It is time for Congress to bring the District of Columbia sharply
into line; for Washington must be made to toe the mark beside New
York. The reputation of the national capital demands it, whether the
gods of the cafes will consent or not.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Florida: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Shooting shore birds and waterfowl in late winter and spring should be stopped.

In the destruction of wild life, I think the backwoods population of
Florida is the most lawless and defiant that can be found anywhere
in the United States. The "plume-hunters" have practically
exterminated the plume-bearing egrets, wholly annihilated the
roseate spoonbill, the flamingo, and also the Carolina parrakeet. On
July 8, 1905, one of them killed an Audubon Association Warden, Guy
M. Bradley, whose business it was to enforce the state laws
protecting the egret rookeries. The people really to blame for the
shooting of Guy Bradley, and the extermination of the egrets by
lawless and dangerous men, are the vain and merciless women who wear
the "white badges of cruelty" as long as they can be purchased! They
have much to answer for!
	</p>
	<p>
Originally, Florida was alive with bird life. For number of species,
abundance of individuals, and general dispersal throughout the whole
state, I think no other state in America except possibly California
ever possessed a bird fauna quite comparable with it. Once its bird
life was one of the wonders of America. But the gunners began early
to shoot, and shoot, and shoot. During the fifteen years preceding
1898, the general bird life of Florida decreased in volume 77 per
cent. In 1900 it was at a very low point, and it has steadily
continued to decrease. The rapidly-growing settlement and
cultivation of the state has of course had much to do with the
disappearance of wild life generally, and the draining and
exploitation of the Everglades will about finish the birds of
southern Florida.
	</p>
	<p>
The brown pelicans' breeding-place on Pelican Island, in Indian
River, has been taken in hand by the national government as a bird
refuge, and its marvelous spectacle of pelican life is now
protected. Nine other islands on the coast of Florida have been
taken as national bird refuges, and will render posterity good
service.
	</p>
	<p>
The great private game and bird preserve of Dr. Ray V. Pierce, at
Apalachicola, known as St. Vincent Island, containing twenty square
miles of wonderful woods and waters, is performing an important
function for the state and the nation.
	</p>
	<p>
The Florida bag limit on quail is entirely too liberal. I know one
man who never once exceeded the limit of twenty birds per day, but
in the season of 1908-9 he killed <i> 865 quail</i>! Can the quail
of any state long endure such drains as that?
	</p>
	<p>
From a zoological point of view, Florida is in bad shape. A great
many of her people who shoot are desperately lawless and
uncontrollable, and the state is not financially able to support a
force of wardens sufficiently strong to enforce the laws, even as
they are. It looks as if the slaughter would go on until nothing of
bird life remains. At present I can see no hope whatever for saving
even a good remnant of the wild life of the state.
	</p>
	<p>
The present status of wild-life protective laws in Florida was made
the subject of an article in <i> Forest and Stream </i> of August
10, 1912, by John H. Wallace, Jr., Game Commissioner of the State of
Alabama, in an article entitled "The Florida Situation." In view of
his record, no one <a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page278] </span> </a> will question either the
value or the honest sincerity of Mr. Wallace's opinions. The
following paragraphs are from that article:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
The enactment of a model and modern game law for the State of
Florida is absolutely imperative in order to save many of the most
valuable species of birds and game of that State from certain
depletion and threatened extinction. The question of the protection
of the birds and game in Florida is not a local one, but is national
in its scope. Birds know no state lines, and while practically all
the States lying to the north of Florida protect migratory birds and
waterfowl, yet these are recklessly slaughtered in that state to
such an extent as to be appalling to all sportsmen and bird lovers.
		</p>
		<p>
So alarming has become the decrease of the birds and game of Florida
that unless a halt is called on the campaign of reckless
annihilation that has been ceaselessly waged in that state, the
sport and recreation enjoyed by primeval nimrods will linger only in
history and tradition.
		</p>
		<p>
It is the sincerest hope of all lovers of wild life of the American
continent that a strong and invincible sentiment, relative to the
imperative necessity of real conservation legislation, be
crystallized in the minds of the members elect of the Florida
Legislature, to the end that the next Legislature will spread upon
the statute books of the State of Florida a model and modern law for
the preservation and protection of the birds and game of that State,
which when put into practical operation will elicit the thanks of
all good citizens, and likewise the gratitude of future generations.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<span class="name"> Georgia: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Prohibit late winter and spring shooting, and provide rational seasons for wild fowl.
		</li>
		<li>
			Reduce the limit on deer to two bucks a season, with horns not less than three inches long.
		</li>
		<li>
			Protect the meadow lark and stop forever the killing of doves and wood-ducks.

		<li>

	<p>
We are glad to report that Georgia has already begun to take up the
white man's burden. The protection of wild life is now a gentleman's
proposition, and in it every real man with red blood in his veins
has a duty to perform. The state of Georgia has recently awakened,
and under the comprehensive law of 1911 has resolutely undertaken to
do her whole duty in this matter.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Idaho: </span>
	<p>
The imperative duties of Idaho are as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Stop all hunting of mountain sheep, mountain goat and elk.
		</li>
		<li>
			Give the sage grouse and sharp-tail ten-year close seasons, at once, to forestall their extermination.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stop the killing of doves as "game."
		</li>
		<li>
			Stop the killing of female deer, and of bucks with horns less than three inches long.
		</li>
		<li>
			Enact the model law to protect non-game birds.
		</li>
		<li>
			Prohibit the use of machine shot-guns in hunting.
		</li>
		<li>
			Extend the State Warden's term to four years.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Like Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, the state of Idaho has wasted
her stock of game, and it is to be feared that several species are
now about to disappear from that state. I am told that the sage
grouse is almost "gone"; and I think that the antelope, caribou, and
mountain sheep are in the same condition of scarcity.
	</p>
	<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page279] </span> </a>
	<p>
If the people of Idaho wish to save their wild fauna, they must be
up and doing. The time to temporize, theorize, be conservative and
easy-going has gone by. It is that fatal policy that causes men to
slumber until it is too late to act; and we will watch with keen
interest to see whether the real men of Idaho are big enough to do
their whole duty in time to benefit their state.
	</p>
	<p>
In 1910, Dr. T.S. Palmer credited Idaho with the possession of about
five hundred moose and two hundred antelope.
	</p>
	<p>
There is one feature of the Idaho game law that may well stand
unchanged. The open season on "ibex," of which one per year may be
killed, may as well be continued. One myth per year is not an
extravagant bag for any intelligent hunter; and it seems that the
"ibex" will not down. Being officially recognized by Idaho, its
place in our fauna now seems assured.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Illinois: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Enact a Bayne law, and stop the sale of all native wild game, regardless of source, and regardless of the gay revelers of Chicago.
		</li>
		<li>
			In Illinois the bag limits on birds are nearly all at least 50 per맊ent too high. They should be as follows: No squirrels, doves or shore birds; six quail, five woodcock, ten coots, ten rail, ten ducks, three geese and three brant, with a total limit of ten waterfowl per day.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doves should be removed from the game list.
		</li>
		<li>
			All tree squirrels and chipmunks should be perpetually protected, as companions to man, unfit for food.
		</li>
		<li>
			The sale of aigrettes should be stopped, and Chicago placed in the same class as Boston, New York, New Orleans and San Francisco.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of all machine shotguns in hunting should be prohibited.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
The chief plague-spots for the grinding up of American game are
Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco. St.
Louis cleared her record in 1909. New York thoroughly cleaned her
Augean stable in 1911, and Massachusetts won her Bayne law by a
desperate battle in 1912. In 1913, Pennsylvania probably will enact
a Bayne law.
	</p>
	<p>
Fancy a city in the center of the United States sending to Norway
for 1,500 ptarmigan, to eat, as Chicago did in 1911; and that was
only one order.
	</p>
	<p>
For forty years the marshes, prairies, farms and streams of the
whole upper Mississippi Valley have been combed year after year by
the guns of the market shooters. Often the migratory game was
located by telegraphic reports. Game birds were slain by the
wagon-load, boat-load, barrel, and car-load, "for the Chicago
market." And the fool farmers of the Middle West stolidly plowed
their fields and fed their hogs, and permitted the slaughter to go
on. To-day the sons of those farmers go to the museums and
zoological parks of the cities to see specimens of pinnated grouse,
crane, woodcock, ducks and other species that the market shooters
have "wiped out"; and their fathers wax eloquent in telling of the
flocks of <a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page280] </span> </a> pigeons that "darkened the sky," and the big
droves of prairie chickens that used to rise out of the corn-fields
"with a roar like a coming storm."
	</p>
	<p>
To-day, Chicago stands half-way reformed. Her markets are open to
only one-half the game killable in Illinois, but they are wide open
to all "<i>legally </i> killed game imported from other states, from
Oct. 1 to Feb. 1." Through that hole in her game laws any
game-dealer can drive a moving-van! Of course, any game offered in
Chicago has been "legally killed in some other state!" Who can prove
otherwise?
	</p>
	<p>
In addition to the imported game illegally killed in other states,
the starving population of Chicago may also buy for cash, and
consume with their champagne in November and December, all the
Illinois doves that can be combed out by the market-gunners.
	</p>
	<p>
After the awful Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago, in 1903, the game
dealers reported a heavy falling off in the consumption of game! The
tragedy caused the temporary closing of the theaters, and the
falling off in after-theater suppers may be said to have taken away
the appetites of thousands of erstwhile consumers of game.
Incidentally it showed who consumes purchased game.
	</p>
	<p>
The people of Illinois should now enact a full-fledged Bayne law,
without changing a single word, and bring Chicago up to the level of
New York, St. Louis and Boston.
	</p>
	<p>
The present bag limits on Illinois game birds are fatally high. As
they stand, with 190,000 licensed gunners in the field each year,
what else do they mean than extermination? The men of Illinois have
just two alternatives between which to choose: drastic and immediate
preservation, or a gameless state. Which shall it be?
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Indiana: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Indiana should hasten to stop spring shooting.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should enact a law, prohibiting the sale for millinery purposes of the plumage of all wild birds save ducks killed in their open season.
		</li>
		<li>
			A Bayne law, absolutely prohibiting the sale of all native wild game, should be enacted at once.
		</li>
		<li>
			The killing of squirrels should be prohibited; because they are not white men's game.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ruffed grouse and quail should have five year close seasons.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of pump and autoloading guns in hunting should be prohibited.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
In Indiana the white-tailed deer is extinct. This means very close
hunting, and a bad outlook for all other game larger than the
sparrow. On October 2, 1912, eleven heads of greater bird of
paradise, with plumes attached, were offered for sale within one
hundred feet of the headquarters of the Fourth National Conservation
Congress. The prices ranged from $35 to $47.50; and while we looked,
two ladies came up, one of whom pointed to a bird-of-paradise corpse
and said: "There! I want one o' them, an' I'm a-goin' to <i> have
</i> it, too!"
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Iowa: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Spring shooting should be stopped, at once and forever. <a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page281]</span> </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			The killing of all tree squirrels and chipmunks should cease.
		</li>
		<li>
			All shore birds that visit Iowa deserve a five-year close season.
		</li>
		<li>
			Especially is the shooting of plover, sandpiper, marsh and beach birds, rail, duck, geese and brant from September 1, to April 15, an outrage.
		</li>
		<li>
			Iowa should prohibit the use of the machine guns, and it is to be hoped that she will awaken sufficiently to do so.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It is said that the Indian word "Iowa" means "the drowsy, or sleepy
ones." Politically, and educationally, Iowa is all right, but in the
protection of wild life she is ten years behind the times, in almost
everything save the prohibition of the sale of game. <i> Iowa knows
better than to pursue the course that she does</i>! She boasts about
her corn and hogs, but she is deaf to the appeals of the states
surrounding her on the subject of spring shooting. For years
Minnesota has set her a good example; but nothing moves her to step
up where she belongs in the phalanx of intelligent game-protecting
states.
	</p>
	<p>
The foregoing may sound harsh, but in view of what other states have
endured from Iowa's stubbornness regarding migratory game, the time
for silent treatment of her case has gone by. She is to-day in the
same class as North Carolina, South Carolina and Maryland,&mdash;at
the tail end of the procession of states. She cares everything for
corn and hogs, but little for wild life.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Kansas: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Spring shooting should be stopped, at once: with apologies for not having done so long ago.
		</li>
		<li>
			The continued shooting of prairie chickens when the species is near extermination is outrageous, and should be prohibited for ten years.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doves should be removed permanently from the game list, partly as a measure of self respect.
		</li>
		<li>
			Kansas should treat herself to a force of salaried game wardens rendering real service.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should bar out the machine guns as unfit for use in a well-regulated State.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Kansas has calmly witnessed the extermination of her bison, elk,
deer, antelope, wild turkeys, sage grouse, whooping cranes, and the
beginning of the end of her pinnated grouse, without a pang. What is
wild game in comparison with fat hogs, and
seventy-bushels-to-the-acre!
	</p>
	<p>
Draw a line around the hog-and-corn area of the United States, and
within it you will find more spring shooting, more sale of game and
more extermination of species than in any other area in the United
States. I refer to Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. In not one of these states
except Missouri is there any big game hunting, and in the majority
of them spring shooting is lawful!
	</p>
	<p>
In the Island of Mauritius, it was swine that exterminated the dodo.
In the United States, hogs and game extermination still go hand in
hand. Since the days of the dodo, however, a new species of swine
has been developed. It is now widely known as the "game-hog," and it
has been officially recognized by both bench and bar.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Kentucky: </span> <a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page282] </span> </a>
	<p>
Nearly everything that a state should maintain in the line of wild
life protection <i> Kentucky lacks</i>! It is easier to tell what
she has than to recite what she should have. Kentucky <i> permits
spring shooting</i>; she has <i> no bag limits</i>, and she has <i>
long open seasons </i> on everything save introduced pheasants; She
protects from sale only quail, grouse and wild turkey <i> killed
within her own borders</i>. This means that her markets are
practically wide open.
	</p>
	<p>
Until recently the people of Kentucky have been very indifferent to
the value of her wild-life; but with the new law enacted this year
providing for a game commission and a game protection fund, surely
every member of the Army of the Defense will wish God-speed to her
efforts in game conservation, and stand ready to lend a helping hand
whenever help can be utilized.
	</p>
	<p>
Kentucky should at one grand coup <i> stop spring shooting and all
sale of wild game, accord long close seasons to all species that are
verging on extinction, protect doves, establish moderate bag limits
and stop the use of machine guns</i>. If she takes up these measures
at the rate of only one at each legislative session, by the time her
laws are perfect <i> all her game will be gone</i>!
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Louisiana: </span>
	<p>
On more counts than one, Louisiana is in the list of Great
Delinquents; for behold the things that she needs to do:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Protect deer for five years.
		</li>
		<li>
			Instantly take the robin, red-winged black-bird, dove, grosbeak, wood-duck and gull off the list of birds that may be killed as "game."
		</li>
		<li>
			Stop all late winter and spring shooting.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stop the sale of all native game, and the possession and transportation of game sold or intended for sale. In short,
		</li>
		<li>
			Enact a Bayne law.
		</li>
		<li>
			Re-establish a game warden system.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
In legally permitting the slaughter of the robin, red-winged
blackbird, dove, grosbeak, wood-duck and gull the state of Louisiana
is very culpable.
	</p>
	<p>
For good reasons, forty states of the American Union strictly
prohibit the killing of song and insectivorous birds. The duty of
every state to protect those birds is not a debatable proposition. I
put this question to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina, Tennessee and other states where the robin is treated as a
game bird: Is it fair of you to kill and eat robins when that
species is carefully protected by forty other states of our country
for grave economic reasons? What would you say of the people of the
North if they slaughtered your mockingbird <i> to eat</i>!
	</p>
	<p>
Remember this proportion:
	</p>
	<p>
The Robin : The North :: The Mockingbird : The South.

		NEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES

<div class="statelist">
	<span class="name"> Maine: </span>
	<p>
There are reasons for the belief that Maine is conserving her large
game better than any other state or province in North America. One
glance over her laws is sufficient to convince anyone that instead
of studying the clamor of her shooting population, Maine has
actually been studying the needs of her game, and providing for
those needs. If all other states were doing equally well, the task
of writing a book of admonition would have been unnecessary. The
proof of Maine's alertness is to be found in the number of her extra
short, or entirely closed, seasons on game. For example:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Cow and calf moose are permanently protected.
		</li>
		<li>
			Only bull moose, with at least two 3-inch prongs on its horns, may be killed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Caribou have had a close season since 1899.
		</li>
		<li>
			On gray and black squirrels, doves and quail, there is no open season.
		</li>
		<li>
			The open season for deer varies from ten weeks to four weeks, and in parts of three counties there is no open season at all.
		</li>
		<li>
			Silencers are prohibited, and firearms in forests may be prohibited by the Governor during droughts.
		</li>
		<li>
			Nearly all wild-fowl shooting ends January 1, but in two places, on December 1.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
People who have not learned the facts habitually think of Maine as a
vast killing-ground for deer; and it is well for it to be known that
the hunting-grounds have been carefully designated, according to the
abundance or scarcity of game.
	</p>
	<p>
Maine has wisely chosen to regard her hunting-grounds and her deer
as a valuable asset, and she manages them accordingly. To be a guide
in that state is to be a good citizen, and a protector of game from
illegal slaughter. No non-resident may hunt without a licensed
guide. The licenses for the thousands of deer killed in Maine each
year, and the expenses of the visiting sportsmen who hunt them,
annually bring into the state and leave there a huge sum of money,
variously estimated at from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000. One can only
guess at the amount from the number of non-resident licenses issued;
but certainly the total can not be less than $1,000,000.
	</p>
	<p>
Although Mr. L.T. Carleton is no longer chairman of the Commission
of Inland Fisheries and Game, the splendid services that he rendered
the state of Maine during his thirteen years of service, especially
in the creation of a good code of game laws, constitute an
imperishable monument to his name and fame.
	</p>
	<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page284] </span> </a>
	<p>
There is very little that Maine needs in the line of new
legislation, or better protection to her game. With the enactment of
a resident license law and a five-year close season for woodcock,
plover, snipe and sandpipers, I think her laws for the protection of
wild life would be sufficiently perfect for all practical purposes.
The Pine-Tree State is to be congratulated upon its wise and
efficient handling of the wild-life situation.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Maryland: </span>
	<p>
How has it come to pass that Maryland <i> lacks </i> more good
wild-life laws than any other state in the Union except North
Carolina? Of the really fundamental protective laws, embracing the
list that to every self-respecting state seems indispensable,
Maryland has almost none save certain bag-limit laws! Otherwise, the
state is wide open! It is indeed high time that she should abandon
her present attitude of hostility to wild life, and become a good
neighbor. She should do what is <i> fair </i> and <i> right </i>
about the protection of the migratory game and bird life that
annually passes twice through her territory!
	</p>
	<p>
At the last session of the Maryland legislature, the law preventing
the use of power boats in wild-fowl shooting was repealed. That was
a step ten years backward; and Maryland should be ashamed of it!
	</p>
	<p>
The list of things that Maryland must do in order to clear her
record is a long one. Here it is:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Local regulations should be replaced by a uniform state law.
		</li>
		<li>
			The sale of all native wild game should be stopped.
		</li>
		<li>
			Spring and late winter shooting of game should be stopped.
		</li>
		<li>
			All non-game birds not already included under the statutes should be protected.
		</li>
		<li>
			The exportation of all game should be prohibited, unless accompanied by the man who shot it, bearing his license, and the law should be state-wide instead of depending upon a separate enactment for each county.
		</li>
		<li>
			There should be a hunter's license law for all who hunt.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped, at once.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stop the use of power boats in wild-fowl shooting.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Massachusetts: </span>
	<p>
In 1912 the state of Massachusetts moved up into the foremost rank
of states, where for one year New York had stood alone. She passed a
counterpart of the New York law, absolutely prohibiting the sale of
all wild American game in Massachusetts, but providing for the sale
of game that has been reared in preserves and tagged by state
officers. This victory was achieved only after three months of hard
fighting. The coalition of sportsmen, zoologists and friends of wild
life in general proved irresistible, just as a similar union of
forces accomplished the Bayne law in New York in 1911. The victory
is highly instructive, as great victories usually are. It proves
once more that whenever the American people can be aroused from
their normal apathy regarding wild life, <i> any good conservation
legislation can be enacted! </i> The prime necessities to success
are good measures, good management, a reasonable <a name="Page_285"
id="Page_285"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page285] </span> </a>
campaign fund, and tireless energy and persistence. Massachusetts is
to be roundly congratulated on having so thoroughly cleaned up her
sale-of-game situation.
	</p>
	<p>
Incidentally, five bills for the repeal of the Massachusetts law
against spring shooting were introduced, and each one went down to
the defeat that it deserved. <i> The repeal of a spring-shooting
law, anywhere, is a step backward ten years! </i>
	</p>
	<p>
Massachusetts needs a bag-limit law more in keeping with her small
remnant of wild life; and that she will have ere long. Very soon,
also, her sportsmen will raise the standard of ethics in shotgun
shooting, by barring out the automatic and pump shotguns so much
beloved by the market shooters. As matters stand at this date (1912)
the Old Bay State needs the following new laws:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Low bag limits on all game.
		</li>
		<li>
			Five-year close seasons on all shore birds, snipe and woodcock.
		</li>
		<li>
			Expulsion of the automatic and pump shotguns, in hunting.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Michigan: </span>
	<p>
On the whole, the game laws of Michigan are in excellent shape, and
leave little to be desired in the line of betterment except to be
simplified. All the game protected by the laws of the state is
debarred from sale; squirrels, pinnated grouse, doves and wild
turkeys enjoy long close seasons; the bag limits on deer and game
birds are reasonably low; spring shooting still is possible on nine
species of ducks; and this should be stopped without delay.
	</p>
	<p>
Only three or four suggestions are in order:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			All spring shooting should be prohibited.
		</li>
		<li>
			All shore birds should have a five-year close season.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of the machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped.
		</li>
		<li>
			The laws should permit the sale, under tag, of all species of game that can successfully be reared in preserves on a commercial basis.
		</li>
		<li>
			Two or three state game preserves, for deer, each at least four miles square, should be established without delay.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Minnesota: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			This state should at once enact a bag-limit law that will do some good, instead of the statutory farce now on the books. Make it fifteen birds per day of waterfowl, all species combined, and no grouse or quail.
		</li>
		<li>
			There should be five-year close seasons enacted for quail, grouse, plover, woodcock, snipe, and all other shore birds.
		</li>
		<li>
			A law should be enacted prohibiting the use of firearms by unnaturalized aliens, and a $20 license for all naturalized aliens.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provision should be made for a large state game refuge in southern Minnesota.
		</li>
		<li>
			The state should prohibit the use of machine guns in hunting.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
To-day, direct and reliable advices show that the game situation in
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page286]
</span> </a> Minnesota is far from encouraging. Several species are
threatened with extinction at an early date. In northern Minnesota
it is reported that much game is surreptitiously trapped and
slaughtered. The bob white is reported as threatened with total
extinction at an early date; but I think the prairie chicken will be
the first bird species to go. Moose will soon be extinct everywhere
in Minnesota except in the game preserves. Apparently there is now
about one duck in Minnesota for every ten ducks that were there only
ten years ago.
	</p>
	<p>
Now, what is Minnesota going to do about all this? Is she willing
through Apathy to become a gameless state? Her people need to arouse
themselves <i> now</i>, and pass several <i> strong </i> laws. Her
bag limit of forty-five birds <i> per day </i> of quail, grouse,
woodcock and plover, and <i> fifty </i> per day of the waterbirds,
is a joke, and nothing more; but it is no laughing matter. It spells
extermination.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Mississippi: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The legalized slaughter of robins, cedar birds, grosbeaks and doves should cease immediately, on the basis of economy of resources and a square deal to all the states lying northward of Mississippi.
		</li>
		<li>
			The shooting of all water-fowl should cease on January 1.
		</li>
		<li>
			A reasonable limit should be established on deer.
		</li>
		<li>
			A hunting license law should be passed at once, fixing the fee at $1 and devoting the revenue to the pay of a corps of non-political game wardens, selected on a basis of ability and fitness.
		</li>
		<li>
			The administration of the game laws should be placed in charge of a salaried game commissioner.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It is seriously to the discredit of Mississippi that her laws
actually classify robins, cedar-birds, grosbeaks and doves as
"game," and <i> make them killable as such from Sept. 1 to March 1!
</i> I should think that if no economic consideration carried weight
in Mississippi, state pride alone would be sufficient to promote a
correction of the evil. If we of the North were to slaughter
mockingbirds for food, when they come North to visit us, the men of
the South would call us greedy barbarians; and they would be quite
right.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Missouri: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The Missouri bag limits that permit the killing or possession of fifty birds per day are absurd, and fatally liberal. The utmost should be twenty-five; and even that is too high.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doves should be taken off the list of game birds, and protected throughout the year; and so should all tree squirrels.
		</li>
		<li>
			Spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited without delay.
		</li>
		<li>
			A law against automatic and pump guns should be enacted at the next legislative session, as a public lesson on the raising of the standard of ethics in shooting.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
The state of Missouri is really strong in her position as a
game-protecting state. She perpetually protects such vanishing
species as the ruffed grouse, prairie chicken (pinnated grouse),
woodcock, and all her shore birds save snipe and plover. She
prohibits the sale of native game and the killing of female deer;
but she wisely permits the <a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page287] </span> </a> sale of preserve-bred elk
and deer under the tags of the State Game Commission. For nearly all
the wild game that is accessible, her markets are tightly closed.
	</p>
	<p>
We heartily congratulate Missouri on her advanced position on the
sale of game, and we hope that the people of Iowa will even yet
profit by her good example.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Montana: </span>
	<p>
Like Colorado and Wyoming, Montana is wasting a valuable heritage of
wild game while she struggles to maintain the theory that she still
is in the list of states that furnish big-game hunting. It is a fact
that ten years ago most sportsmen began to regard Montana as a
has-been for big game, and began to seek better hunting-grounds
elsewhere. British Columbia, Alberta and Alaska have done much for
the game of Montana by drawing sportsmen away from it. Mr. Henry
Avare, the State Game Warden, is optimistic regarding even the big
game, and believes that it is holding its own. This is partially
true of white-tailed deer, or it was up to the time of great
slaughter. It is said that in 1911, 11,000 deer were killed in
Montana, all in the western part of the state, seventy per cent of
which were white-tails. The deep snows and extreme cold of a long
and unusually severe winter drove the hungry deer down out of the
mountains into the settlements, where the ranchmen joyously
slaughtered them. The destruction around Kalispell was described by
Harry P. Stanford as "sickening."
	</p>
	<p>
Mr. Avare estimates the prong-horned antelope in Montana at three
thousand head, of which about six hundred are under the
quasi-protection of four ranches.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The antelope need three or four small ranges, such as the Snow Creek Antelope Range, where the bad lands are too rough for ranchmen, but quite right for antelopes and other big game.
		</li>
		<li>
			All the grouse and ptarmigan of Montana need a five-year close season. The splendid sage grouse is now extinct in many parts of its previous range. Fifty-eight thousand licensed gunners are too many for them!
		</li>
		<li>
			The few mountain sheep and mountain goats that survive should have a five-year close season, at once.
		</li>
		<li>
			The killing of female hoofed animals should be prohibited by law.
		</li>
		<li>
			Montana has not yet adopted the model law for the protection of non-game birds. Only seven states have failed in that respect.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of automatic and pump shotguns, and silencers, should immediately be prohibited.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Montana's bag-limits are not wholly bad; but the grizzly bear has
almost been exterminated, save in the Yellowstone Park. Some of
these days, if things go on as they are now going, the people of
Montana will be rudely awakened to the fact that they have 50,000
licensed hunters but no longer any killable game! And then we will
hear enthusiastic talk about "restocking."
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Nebraska: </span>
	<p>
No other state has bestowed close seasons upon as many extinct
species <a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page288] </span> </a> of game as Nebraska. Behold how she has
resolutely locked the doors of her empty cage after all these
species have flown: Elk, antelope, wild turkey, passenger pigeon,
whooping crane, sage grouse, ptarmigan and curlew. In a short time
the pinnated grouse can be added to the list of has-beens.

	<p>
There is little to say regarding the future of the game of Nebraska;
for its "future" is now history.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Provision should be made for one or more state game preserves.
		</li>
		<li>
			Spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited.
		</li>
		<li>
			A larger and more effective warden service should be provided.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doves should be removed from the game list.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Nevada: </span>

			The sage grouse should be given a ten-year close season, for recuperation.
		</li>
		<li>
			All non-game birds should have perpetual protection.
		</li>
		<li>
			The cranes, now verging on extinction, and the pigeons and doves should at once be taken out of the list of game birds, and forever protected.
		</li>
		<li>
			All the shore birds need five years of close protection.
		</li>
		<li>
			A State Game Warden whose term of office is not less than four years should be provided for.
		</li>
		<li>
			A corps of salaried game protectors should be chosen for active and aggressive game protection.

		<li>
			Nevada's bag limits are among the best of any state, the only serious flaw being "10 sage grouse" per day: which should be 0!

	</ul>
	<p>
Nevada still has a few antelope; and <i> we beg her to protect them
all from being hunted or killed! </i> It is my belief that if the
antelope is really saved anywhere in the United States outside of
national parks and preserves, it will be in the wild and remote
regions of Nevada, where it is to be hoped that lumpy-jaw has not
yet taken hold of the herds.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> New Hampshire: </span>
	<p>
Speaking generally, the New Hampshire laws regulating the killing
and shipment of game are defective for the reason that on birds, and
in fact all game save deer, there appear to be no "bag" limits on
the quantity that may be killed in a day or a season. The following
bag limits are greatly needed, forthwith:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Gray Squirrel, none per day, or per year; duck (except wood-duck), ten per day, or thirty per season; ruffed grouse, four per day, twelve per season; hare and rabbit, four per day, or twelve per season.
		</li>
		<li>
			Five-year close seasons should immediately be enacted for the following species: quail, woodcock, jacksnipe and all species of shore or "beach" birds.
		</li>
		<li>
			The sale of all native wild game should be prohibited; and game-breeding in preserves, and the sale of such game under state supervision, should be provided for.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be barred,&mdash;through state pride, if for no other reason.

	</ul>
	<span class="name"> New Jersey: </span>
	<p>
New Jersey enjoys the distinction of being the second state to break
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page289]
</span> </a> the strangle-hold of the gun-makers of Hartford and
Ilion, and cast out the odious automatic and pump guns. It was a
pitched battle,&mdash;that of 1912, inaugurated by Ernest Napier,
President of the State Game and Fish Commission and his fellow
commissioners. The longer the contest continued, the more did the
press and the people of New Jersey awaken to the seriousness of the
situation. Finally, the gun-suppression bill passed the two houses
of the legislature with a total of only fourteen votes against it,
and after a full hearing had been granted the attorneys of the
gunmakers, was promptly signed by Governor Woodrow Wilson. <i>
Governor Wilson could not be convinced that the act was
"unconstitutional," or "confiscatory" or "class legislation." </i>
	</p>
	<p>
This contest aroused the whole state to the imperative necessity of
providing more thorough protection for the remnant of New Jersey
game, and it was chiefly responsible for the enactment of four other
excellent new protective laws.
	</p>
	<p>
New Jersey always has been sincere in her desire to protect her wild
life, and always has gone <i> as far as the killers of game would
permit her to go! </i> But the People have made one great
mistake,&mdash;common to nearly every state,&mdash;of permitting the
game-killers to dictate the game laws! <i> Always and everywhere,
this is a grievous mistake</i>, and fatal to the game. For example:
In 1866 New Jersey enacted a five-year close-season law on the
"prairie fowl" (pinnated grouse); but it was too late to save it.
Now that species is as dead to New Jersey as is the mastodon. The
moral is: Will the People apply this lesson to the ruffed grouse,
quail and the shore birds generally before they, too, are too far
gone to be brought back? If it is done, it must be done <i> against
the will of the gunners; </i> for they prefer to shoot,&mdash;and
shoot they will if they can dictate the laws, until the last game
bird is dead.
	</p>
	<p>
In 1912, New Jersey is spending $30,000 in trying to restock her
birdless covers with foreign game birds and quail. In brief, here
are the imperative duties of New Jersey:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Provide eight-year close seasons for quail, ruffed grouse, woodcock, snipe, all shore birds and the wood-duck.
		</li>
		<li>
			Prohibit the sale of all native wild game; but promote the sale of preserve-bred game.
		</li>
		<li>
			Prevent the repeal of the automatic gun law, which surely will be attempted, each year.
		</li>
		<li>
			Prohibit all bird-shooting after January 10, each year, until fall.
		</li>
		<li>
			Prohibit the killing of squirrels as "game."
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> New Mexico: </span>
	<p>
All things considered, the game laws of New Mexico are surprisingly
up to date, and the state is to be congratulated on its advanced
position. For example, there are long close seasons on antelope, elk
(now extinct!), mountain sheep, bob white quail, pinnated grouse,
wild pigeon and ptarmigan,&mdash;an admirable list, truly. It is
clear that New Mexico is wide awake to the dangers of the wild-life
situation. On two counts, her laws are not quite perfect. There is
no law prohibiting spring shooting, <a name="Page_290"
id="Page_290"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page290] </span> </a> and
there is no "model law" protecting the non-game birds. The sale of
game will not trouble New Mexico, because the present laws prevent
the sale of all protected game except plover, curlew and
snipe,&mdash;all of them species by no means common in the arid
regions of the Southwest.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be passed at the next session of the legislature.
		</li>
		<li>
			The enactment of the "model law" should be accomplished without delay to put New Mexico abreast of the neighboring states of Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas.
		</li>
		<li>
			The term of the State Warden should be extended to four years.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> New York: </span>
	<p>
In the year of grace, 1912, I think we may justly regard New York as
the banner state of all America in the protection of game and wild
life in general. This proud position has been achieved partly
through the influence of a great conservation Governor, John A. Dix,
and the State Conservation Commission proposed and created by his
efforts. In these days of game destruction, when our country from
Nome to Key West is reeking with the blood of slaughtered wild
creatures, it is a privilege and a pleasure to be a citizen of a
state which has thoroughly cleaned house, and done well nigh the
utmost that any state can do to clear her bad record, and give all
her wild creatures a fair chance to survive. The people of the
Empire State literally can point with pride to the list of things
accomplished in the discharge of good-citizenship toward the remnant
of wild life, and toward the future generations of New Yorkers. That
we of to-day have borne our share of the burden of bringing about
the conditions of 1912, will be a source of satisfaction, especially
when the sword and shield hang useless upon the walls of Old Age.
	</p>
	<p>
New York began to protect her deer in 1705 and her heath hens in
1708. In 1912 she stopped the killing of female deer, and of bucks
having horns less than three inches in length. Spring shooting was
stopped in 1903. A comprehensive law protecting non-game birds was
enacted in 1862. New York's first law against the sale of certain
game during close seasons was enacted in 1837.
	</p>
	<p>
In 1911 New York enacted, with only one adverse vote, a law
prohibiting the sale of all native wild game throughout the state,
no matter where killed, and providing liberally for the
encouragement of game-breeding, and the sale of preserve-bred game.
	</p>
	<p>
In 1912 a new codification of the state game laws went into effect,
through the initiative of Governor Dix and Conservation
Commissioners Van Kennen, Moore and Fleming, assisted (as special
counsel) by Marshall McLean, George A. Lawyer and John B. Burnham.
This code contains many important new provisions, one of the most
valuable of which is a clause giving the Conservation Commission
power, at its discretion, to shorten or to close any open season on
any species of game in any locality wherein that species seems to be
threatened with extermination. This very valuable principle should
be enacted into law in every state!
	</p>
	<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page291] </span> </a>
	<p>
In 1910, William Dutcher and T. Gilbert Pearson and the National
Association of Audubon Societies won, after a struggle lasting five
years, the passage of the "Shea plumage bill," prohibiting the sale
of aigrettes or other plumage of wild birds belonging to the same
families as the birds of New York (Chap. 256). This law <i> should
be duplicated in every state. </i>
	</p>
	<p>
<i> Two things </i> remain to be done in the state of New York.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			All the shore birds, quail and gray squirrels of the state should be given five-year close seasons, by the action of the State Conservation Commission.
		</li>
		<li>
			For the good name of the state, and the ethical standing of its sportsmen, as an example to other states, and the last remaining duty toward our wild life, the odious automatic and pump shotguns should be barred from use in hunting, unless their capacity is reduced to two shots without reloading.

<div class="statelist">
	<span class="name"> North Carolina: </span>
	<p>
The game laws of North Carolina form a droll crazy-quilt of local
and state measures, effective and ineffective. In 1909, a total of
77 local game laws were enacted, and only two of state-wide
application. During the ten years ending in 1910, a total of 316
game laws were enacted! She sedulously endeavors to protect her
quail, which do not migrate, but in Currituck County she
persistently maintains the bloodiest slaughter-pen for waterfowl
that exists anywhere on the Atlantic Coast. There is no bag limit on
waterfowl, and unlimited spring shooting. So far as waterfowl are
concerned, conditions could hardly be worse, except by the use of
punt guns. Doves, <i> larks </i> and <i> robins </i> are shot and
eaten as "game" from November 1 to March 1! Twenty-one counties have
local restrictions on the sale of game, but the state at large has
only one,&mdash;on quail.
	</p>
	<p>
The market gunners of Currituck Sound are a scourge and a pest to
the wild-fowl life of the Atlantic Coast. For their own money
profit, they slaughter by wholesale the birds that annually fly
through twenty-two states. It is quite useless to suggest anything
to North Carolina in modern game laws. As long as a killable bird
remains, she will not stop the slaughter. Her standing reply is "It
brings a lot of money into Currituck County; and the people want the
money." Even the members of the sportsmen's clubs can shoot wild
fowl in Currituck County, quite without limit; and I am told that
the privilege often is abused. Quite recently I heard of a member of
one of the clubs who shot 164 ducks and geese in two days!
	</p>
	<p>
Apparently any suggestions made to North Carolina would not be
treated seriously, especially if they would tend really to elevate
the sport of game shooting, or better protect the game. There is,
however, a melancholy interest attached to the framing of good game
laws, whether they ever are likely to be adopted or not. Here is the
duty of North Carolina:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Stop the killing of robins, doves and larks for food, absolutely and forever. This measure is necessary to agriculture and to the good name of the state.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stop the shooting of any game for sale, prohibit the possession of game for sale, and the sale of wild native game.
		</li>
		<li>
			Establish bag limits on all waterfowl, and on all other game birds and mammals. <a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page293]</span> </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Prepare to protect, at an early date, the wild turkey and quail; for soon they will need it. Moreover, enact a law prohibiting the use of automatic and pump guns in hunting, covering the entire state.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provide a resident-license system and thereby make the game department self-sustaining, and render it possible to employ a salaried State Game Commissioner.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It is quite wrong for the people of North Carolina to hold grudges
against northern members of the ducking clubs of Currituck for the
passage of the Bayne law. They had nothing whatever to do with it,
and I can say this because I was in a position which enabled me to
know.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> North Dakota: </span>
	<p>
In 1911, this sovereign state enacted a law <i> prohibiting the use
of automobiles </i> in hunting wild-fowl; also rifles. North Dakota
was the first state to recognize officially the fact that the use of
automobiles in hunting is a serious menace to some forms of wild
life. Beyond all question, the machines do indeed bring an extra
number of birds within reach of the gun! They increase the annual
slaughter; and it is right and necessary to prohibit by law their
use in hunting game of any kind.
	</p>
	<p>
In Putman County, New York, I have seen them in action. A load of
three or four gunners is whirled up to a likely mountain-side for
ruffed grouse, and presently the banging begins. After an hour or so
spent in combing out the birds, the hunters jump in, whirl away in a
dust-cloud to another spot two miles away, and "bang-bang-bang"
again. After that, a third locality; and so on, covering six or
eight times the territory that a man in a buggy, or on foot, could
possibly shoot over in the same time!
	</p>
	<p>
North Dakota has done well, in the passage of that act. On certain
other matters, she is not so sound.
	</p>
	<p>
For instance:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The killing of pinnated grouse should be stopped for ten years; and it should be done immediately.
		</li>
		<li>
			The killing of cranes as "game" should stop, instantly and forever. It is barbarous.
		</li>
		<li>
			Fifty dead birds in possession at one time is fully thirty too many. The game cannot stand such slaughter!
		</li>
		<li>
			All shore birds (<i>Order Limicolae</i>) should have at least a five-year close season, before they are exterminated.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of machine guns in hunting should be stopped, forever.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It is to the credit of the state that antelope are absolutely
protected until 1920, and an unlimited close season has been
accorded the quail, dove and swan.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Ohio: </span>
	<p>
I think that Ohio comes the nearest of all the states to being
gameless. With but slight exceptions her laws are about as correct
as those of most other states, but the desire to "kill" is so
strong, and the majority of her gunners are so thoroughly selfish
about their "rights" <a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page294] </span> </a> that the game has
ruthlessly been swept away <i> according to law! </i> Ohio is a
striking example of the deplorable results of <i> legalized </i>
slaughter. The spirit of Ohio is like that of North Carolina. Her
"sportsmen" will not have an automatic gun law! Oh, no! "Limit the
bag, shorten the season, and the gun won't matter!"
	</p>
	<p>
To-day, the visible game supply of Ohio does not amount to anything;
and when the last game bird of that state falls before the greediest
shooter, we shall say, "A gameless state is just what you deserve!"
	</p>
	<p>
It is useless to make any suggestions to Ohio. Her shooting Shylocks
want the last pound of flesh from wild life, and I think they will
get it very soon. Ohio is in the area of barren states. The seed
stock has been too thoroughly destroyed to be recuperated. I think
that Ohio's last noteworthy exploit in lawmaking for the
preservation (!) of her game was in 1904, when she put all her shore
birds into the list of killable game, and bravely prohibited the
shooting of doves <i> on the ground! </i> Great is Ohio in game
conservation!
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Oklahoma: </span>
	<p>
For a state so young, the wild-life laws of Oklahoma are in
admirable shape; but it is reasonably certain that there, as
elsewhere, the game is being killed much faster than it is breeding.
The new commonwealth must arouse, and screw up the brakes much
tighter.
	</p>
	<p>
Recently, an observing friend told me that on a trip of 250 miles
westward from Lawton and back again, watching sharply for game all
the way, he saw only five pinnated grouse! And this in a good season
for "prairie chickens."
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Oklahoma must stop all spring shooting.
		</li>
		<li>
			The prairie chicken must have a ten-year close season, immediately.
		</li>
		<li>
			Next time, her legislature will pass the automatic gun bill that failed last year only because the session closed too soon for its consideration.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Oklahoma is wise in giving long protection to her quail, and "wild
pigeon," and such protection should be made equally effective in the
case of the dove. She is wise in rigidly enforcing her law against
the exportation of game.
	</p>
	<p>
The Wichita National Bison herd, near Cache, now contains forty head
of bison, all in good condition. The nucleus herd consisted of
fifteen head presented by the New York Zoological Society in 1907.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Oregon: </span>
	<p>
The results of the efforts that have been made by Oregon to provide
special laws for each individual shooter are painful to contemplate.
Like North Carolina, Oregon has attempted the impossible task of
pleasing everybody, and at the same time protecting her wild life.
The two propositions can be blended together about as easily as
asphalt and <a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page295] </span> </a> water. The individual shooter desires laws
that will permit him to shoot&mdash;<i>when </i> he pleases, <i>
where </i> he pleases, and <i> what </i> he pleases! If you meet
those conditions all over a great state, then it is time to bid
farewell to the game; for it surely is doomed.
	</p>
	<p>
No, decidedly no! Do not attempt to pass game laws that will "please
everybody." The more the game-hogs are <i> displeased</i>, the
better for the game! The game-hogs form a very small and very
insignificant minority of the whole People. Why please one man at
the expense of ninety-nine others? The game of a state belongs to
The People as a whole, not to the gunners alone. The great,
patient,&mdash;and sometimes sleepy,&mdash;majority has vested
rights in it, and it is for it to say how it shall and shall not be
killed. Heretofore the gunning minority has been dictating the game
laws of America, and the result is&mdash;progressive extermination.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			First of all, Oregon should bury the pernicious idea of individual and local laws.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should enact a concise, clearly cut, and thoroughly effective code of wild life laws, just as New York did last winter.
		</li>
		<li>
			Her game seasons should be uniform in application, all over the state.
		</li>
		<li>
			Every species of bird, mammal or fish that is threatened with extermination should be given a close season of from five to ten years.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is now time to protect the white goose and brant. Squirrels, band-tailed pigeons and doves should be perpetually protected.
		</li>
		<li>
			The State Game Commission should have power to close the shooting seasons on any species of game in any locality, whenever a species is threatened with extinction.
		</li>
		<li>
			The sale of native wild game, from all sources, should be permanently stopped, by a Bayne law.
		</li>
		<li>
			The use of automatic, "autoloading" and pump shot guns in hunting should be perpetually barred.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Pennsylvania: </span>
	<p>
As a game protecting state, Pennsylvania is a close second to New
York and Massachusetts. She protects all native game from sale; <i>
she has the courage to prohibit aliens from owning guns; she bars
out automatic shot-guns in hunting</i>; she makes refuges for deer,
and feeds her quail in winter, and she permits the killing of no
female deer, or fawns with horns less than three inches in length.
Her splendid State Game Commission is fighting hard for a hunter's
license law, and will win the fight for it at the next session of
the legislature (1913).
	</p>
	<p>
But there are certain things that Pennsylvania should do:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			She should stop all spring shooting. She must stop killing doves, blackbirds, wild turkeys, sandpipers, and all the squirrels save the red squirrel.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should give all her shore birds a rest of at least five years, for recuperation.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should enact a comprehensive Dutcher plumage law, stopping the sale of aigrettes.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should provide a resident license to furnish her Game Commission with adequate funds to carry on its work and exterminate game-killing vermin.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Rhode Island: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Little Rhody needs some good, small bag limits; for now (1912) she has none! <a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page296]</span> </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			She should enact a Bayne law, a Pennsylvania law against aliens, and a New Jersey law against the automatic and pump guns.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should stop killing the beautiful wood-duck, and gray squirrel.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should stop all spring shooting of waterfowl.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> South Carolina: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			She should save her game while she still has some to save.
		</li>
		<li>
			First of all, stop spring shooting; secondly, enact a Bayne law.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the name of mystery, who is there in South Carolina who desires to kill grackles? And why?
		</li>
		<li>
			And where is the gentleman sportsman who has come down to killing foolish and tame little doves for "sport?" Stop it at once, for the credit of the state.
		</li>
		<li>
			Enact a dollar resident license law and thus provide adequate funds for game protection.
		</li>
		<li>
			South Carolina bag limits are all 50 per cent too high; and they should be reduced.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It is strange to see one of the oldest of the states lagging in game
protection, far behind such new states as New Mexico and Oklahoma;
but South Carolina does lag. It is time for her to consider her
position, and reform.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> South Dakota: </span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			South Dakota should stop all spring shooting.
		</li>
		<li>
			Her game-bag limits are really no limits at all! They should be reduced about 66 per cent without a moment's unnecessary delay.
		</li>
		<li>
			The two year term of the State Warden is too short for effective work. It should be extended to four years.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Unless South Dakota wishes to repeat the folly of such states as
Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, she needs to be up and
doing. If her people want a gameless state, except for migratory
waterfowl, all they need do is to slumber on, and they surely will
have it. Why wait until greedy sportsmen have killed the last game
bird of the state before seriously taking the matter in hand? In one
act, all the shortcomings of the present laws can be corrected.
	</p>
	<p>
South Dakota needs no Bayne law, because she prohibits at all times
the sale or exportation of all wild game.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Tennessee: </span>
	<p>
In wild life protection, Tennessee has much to do. She made her
start late in life, and what she needs to do is to draft with care
and enact with cheerful alacrity certain necessary amendments.
	</p>
	<p>
We notice that there are open seasons for <i> blackbirds, robins,
doves and squirrels</i>! It seems incredible; but it is true.
	</p>
	<p>
Behold the blackbird as a "game" bird, with a lawful open season
from September 1 to January 1. Consider its stately carriage, its
rapid flight on the wing, its running and hiding powers when
attacked. As a test of marksmanship, as the real thing for the
expert wing shot, is it <a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page297] </span> </a> not great? Will not any
self-respecting dog be proud to point or retrieve them? And what
flesh for the table!
	</p>
	<p>
Fancy an able-bodied sportsman going out in a fifty-dollar hunting
suit, carrying a fifteen-dollar gun behind a seven-dollar dog, and
returning with a glorious bag of twenty-five blackbirds! Or robins!
Or doves! Proud indeed, would we be to belong (which we don't) to a
club of "sportsmen" who go out shooting blackbirds, and robins, and
foolish little doves, as "game!" "Game" indeed, are those
birds,&mdash;for little lads of seven who do not know better; but
not for boys of twelve who have in their veins any inheritance of
sporting blood. (I am proud of the fact that at twelve years of
age,&mdash;and ever so keen to "go hunting,"&mdash;I knew without
being told that squirrels and doves were not <i> real </i> "game"
for real boys.)
	</p>
	<p>
The killers of doves, squirrels, blackbirds and robins belong in the
same class as the sparrow-and-linnet-killing Italians of Venice,
Milan and Turin, and in that company we will leave them.
	</p>
	<p>
Tennessee needs:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A resident license system to provide funds for game protection.
		</li>
		<li>
			A salaried warden force.
		</li>
		<li>
			A law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl.
		</li>
		<li>
			A law protecting robins, doves and other non-game birds not covered by the present statute.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Texas: </span>
	<p>
I remember well when the great battle was fought in Texas by the
gallant men and women of the State Audubon Society, to compel the
people of Texas to learn the economic value to agriculture and
cotton of the insectivorous birds. The name of the splendid
Brigadier-General who led the Army of the Defense was Capt. M.B.
Davis. That was in 1903.
	</p>
	<p>
Since that great fight was won, Texas has been a partly reformed
state, at times quite jealous of her bird life; but still she
tolerates spring shooting and has not made adequate close seasons
for her waterfowl; which is wrong. To-day, the people of Texas do
not need to be told that forty-three species of birds feed on the
cotton boll weevil; for they know it.
	</p>
	<p>
On the whole, and for a southern state, the wild-life laws of Texas
are in fairly good shape. On account of the absence of game-scourge
markets, a Bayne law is not so imperatively necessary there as in
certain other states. All the game of the state is protected from
sale.
	</p>
	<p>
We do assert, however, that if robins are slaughtered as F.L. Crow,
the former Atlantan asserts, all robin shooting should be forever
stopped; that the pinnated grouse should be given a seven-year close
season, and that doves should be taken off the list of game birds
and perpetually protected, both for economic and sentimental
reasons, and also because the too weak and confiding dove is not a
"game" bird for red-blooded men.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Texas should enact without delay a law providing close seasons for ducks, geese and other waterfowl;
		</li>
		<li>
			A law prohibiting spring shooting, and
		</li>
		<li>
			A provision reducing the limit on deer to two bucks a season.
		</li>

	<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page298] </span> </a> <span class="name"> Utah: </span>
	<p>
The laws of Utah are far from being up to the requirements of the
present hour. One strange thing has happened in Utah.
	</p>
	<p>
When I spent a week in Salt Lake City in 1888, and devoted some time
to inquiring into game conditions, the laws of the state were very
bad. At the mouth of Bear River, ducks were being slaughtered for
the markets by the tens of thousands. The cold-blooded, wide open
and utterly shameless way in which it was being done, right at the
doors of Salt Lake City, was appalling.
	</p>
	<p>
At the same time, the law permitted the slaughter of <i> spotted
fawns</i>. I saw a huge drygoods box filled to the top with the flat
skins of slaughtered innocents, <i> 260 in number</i>, that a rascal
had collected and was offering at fifty cents each. In reply to a
question as to their use, he said: "I tink de sportsmen like 'em for
to make vests oud of." He lived at Rawlins, Wyo.
	</p>
	<p>
After a long and somnolent period, during which hundreds of
thousands of ducks, geese, brant and other birds had been
slaughtered for market at the Bear River shambles and elsewhere, the
state awoke sufficiently to abate a portion of the disgrace by
passing a bag-limit law (1897).
	</p>
	<p>
And then came Nature's punishment upon Utah for that duck slaughter.
The ducks of Great Salt Lake became afflicted with a terrible
epidemic disease (intestinal coccidiosis) which swept off thousands,
and stopped the use of Utah ducks as food! It was a "duck plague,"
no less. It has prevailed for three years, and has not yet by any
means been stamped out. It seems to be due to the fact that
countless thousands of ducks have been feeding on the exposed
alluvial flats at the mouth of the creek that drains off the <i>
sewage of Salt Lake City</i>. The conditions are said to be
terrible.
	</p>
	<p>
To-day, Utah is so nearly destitute of big game that the subject is
hardly worthy of mention. Of her upland game birds, only a fraction
remains, and as her laws stand to-day, she is destined to become in
the near future a gameless state. In a dry region like this, the
wild life always hangs on by a slender thread, and it is easy to
exterminate it!
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Utah should instantly stop the sale of game that she now legally provides for,&mdash;twenty-five shore birds and waterfowl per day to private parties!
		</li>
		<li>
			Deer should be given a ten-year close season, at once. All bag limits should instantly be reduced one-half. The sage grouse, quail, swans, woodcock, dove, and all shore birds should be given a ten-year close season,&mdash;and rigidly protected,&mdash;before the stock is all gone.
		</li>
		<li>
			The model law for the protection of non-game birds should be enacted at once.
		</li>
		<li>
			The absolute protection of elk, antelope and sheep (until 1913) should be extended for twenty years.
		</li>
		<li>
			Utah should create a big-game preserve, at once.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
If Utah proposes to save even a remnant of her wild life for
posterity, she must be up and doing.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Vermont: </span> <a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page299] </span> </a>
	<p>
In view of all conditions, it must be stated that the game laws of
Vermont are, with but slight exceptions, in good condition. It is a
pleasure to see that there is no spring shooting; that there is no
"open" season of slaughter for the moose, caribou, wood-duck, swan,
upland plover, dove or rail; that no buck deer with antlers less
than three inches long may be killed; and that there is a law under
which damages by deer to growing crops may be assessed and paid for
by the county in which they occur. Moreover, if there is to be any
killing of game, her bag limits are not extravagant. All the game
protected by the state is immune from sale for food purposes, but
preserve-reared game may legally be sold. We recommend the following
new measures:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Absolute close seasons of five-years' duration for ruffed grouse, quail, woodcock, snipe and all shore birds without a single exception.
		</li>
		<li>
			The gray squirrel should be perpetually protected,&mdash;because he is too beautiful, too companionable and too unfit for food to be killed. Even the hungry savages of the East Indies do not eat squirrels.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pass an automatic pump-gun law.
		</li>
		<li>
			Extend the term of the Fish and Game Commissioner to four years.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Vermont's great success in introducing and colonizing deer is both
interesting and valuable. Fifty years ago, she had no wild deer,
because the species had been practically exterminated. In 1875,
thirteen deer were imported from the Adirondacks and set free in the
mountains. The increase has been enormous. In 1909 the number of
deer killed for the year was about 5,311, which was possible without
adversely affecting the herds. It is a striking object-lesson in
restoring the white-tailed deer to its own, and it will be found
more fully described in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIV"> chapter XXIV</a>.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Virginia: </span>
	<p>
Virginia is far below the position that she should occupy in
wild-life conservation. To set her house in order, and come up to
the level of the states that have been born during the past twenty
years, she must bestir herself in these ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			She must provide for a resident hunting license, a State Game Commissioner and a force of salaried wardens.
		</li>
		<li>
			She must prohibit spring shooting.
		</li>
		<li>
			She must impose small bag limits on game-slaughter.
		</li>
		<li>
			She must resolutely stop the sale of all wild game.
		</li>
		<li>
			She must stop the killing of female deer, and of bucks with horns under three inches long.
		</li>
		<li>
			She must stop killing gray squirrels and doves as "game."
		</li>
		<li>
			She should not permit the beautiful wood-duck to be killed as "game."
		</li>
		<li>
			She should accord a five-year close season to grouse, and all shore birds.
		</li>
		<li>
			She should rule out the machine shot-guns which gentlemen can no longer use in hunting.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page300] </span> </a>
	<p>
She should adopt at once a comprehensive code of game laws, and
clean her house in one siege, instead of fiddling and fussing with
all these matters one by one, through a series of ten long, weary
years. The time for puttering with game protection has gone by. It
is now time to make short cuts to comprehensive results, and save
the game before it is too late.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Washington: </span>
	<p>
The state of Washington still flatters herself that she has all
kinds of big game to kill,&mdash;moose, antelope, goat, sheep,
caribou and deer. Evidently this is on the theory that so long as a
species is not extinct, it is "legal" and right to pursue it with
rifles during a specified "open season."
	</p>
	<p>
The people of Washington need to be told that conditions have
greatly changed, and it is now high time to put on the brakes. It is
time for them to realize that if they wait any longer for the
sportsmen to take the initiative in securing the enactment of really
adequate preservation laws, all their big game will be dead before
those laws are born! Every man shrinks from cutting off his own pet
privilege.
	</p>
	<p>
Some of the game laws of Washington are up to date; and her big-game
laws look all right to the unaided eye, but are not. Her bird laws
are a chaotic jumble of local exceptions and special privileges. As
a net result of all her shortcomings, the remnant of a once fine
fauna of big game and feathered game is surely being <i>
exterminated according to law. </i> A few local exceptions will not
disprove the general truthfulness of this assertion.
	</p>
	<p>
Ten years ago a few men in Seattle resented the idea of outside
co-operation in the protection of Washington game. They said they
were abundantly able to take care of it; but the march of events has
proven that they overestimated their capacity. To-day the wild-life
laws of that state are only half baked. Come what may to me, I shall
set down without malice the things that the great and admirable
State of Washington should do to set her house in order. It is not
good for the resourceful and progressive men of the Great Northwest
to be clear behind the times in these matters.
	</p>
	<p>
<i> Stop local game legislation, and enact a code of laws covering
the entire state, uniformly. County legislation is twenty years
behind the times! </i>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			For ten (10) full years, stop the killing of elk, mountain sheep, mountain goat, caribou, moose, and antelope. Regarding deer, I am in doubt.
		</li>
		<li>
			Prohibit the sale of all wild game, no matter where killed, by the enactment of a Bayne law, complete, which will also
		</li>
		<li>
			Promote the breeding, killing and sale of domestic game for food purposes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Make a careful investigation of the present status of your sage grouse, every other grouse, quail, and all species of shore birds, then give a five-year close season, all over the state, to every species that is "becoming scarce." This will embrace certainly one-half of the whole number, if not two-thirds.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provide two bird refuges in the eastern portion of the state, where they are very greatly needed to supplement the good effects of the State Game Preserve established on Puget Sound in 1911.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bar the use in hunting of the odious automatic and pump shotguns that are now so generally in use all over the United States to the great detriment of the game and the people.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> West Virginia: </span> <a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page301] </span> </a>
	<p>
Considering the fact that West Virginia contains no plague-spot city
for the consumption of commercial wild game, that the sale of all
game is prohibited at all times, and the game of the state may not
be exported for sale elsewhere, the wild life of West Virginia is
reasonably secure from the market gunner,&mdash;if an adequate
salaried warden force is provided. Without such a force her game
must continue to be destroyed in the future as in the past to supply
the markets of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington.
The deer law is excellent, and the non-game birds, and the dove and
wood-duck are perpetually protected.
	</p>
	<p>
One fly in the ointment is&mdash;spring shooting; which for ducks,
geese and brant continues from September 1 to April 20.
Unfortunately the law enacted in 1875 against spring shooting has
been <i> repealed, </i> and so has the resident hunting license law
(1911).
	</p>
	<p>
In view of the impossibility of imagining a good reason for the
repeal of a good law, we recommend:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			That the law against spring shooting be re-enacted.
		</li>
		<li>
			That the resident hunter's license law be re-enacted, and the proceeds specifically devoted to the preservation and increase of game.
		</li>
		<li>
			That a force of regular salaried wardens be provided to enforce the laws.
		</li>
		<li>
			That the bag limit on quail should be 10 per day or 40 per season, instead of 12 and 96; and on ruffed grouse it should be 3 per day (as in New York) or 12 per season. One wild turkey per day, or three per season is quite enough for one man. The visible supply will not justify the existing limit of two and six.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Wisconsin: </span>
	<p>
In spite of the fierce fight made in 1910-11 by the saloon-element
game-shooters of Milwaukee for the control of the wild-life
situation, and the repeal of the best protective laws of the state,
the Army of Defense once more defeated the Allied Destroyers, and
drove them off the field. Once more it was proven that when The
People are aroused, they are abundantly able to send the steam
roller over the enemies of wild life.
	</p>
	<p>
Alphabetically, Wisconsin may come near the end of the roll-call;
but by downright merit in protection, she comes mighty close to the
head of the list of states. Her slate of "Work to be done" is
particularly clean; and she has our most distinguished admiration.
Her force of game wardens is not a political-machine force. It
amounts to something. The men who get within it undergo successfully
a civil service examination that certainly separates the sheep from
the goats. For particulars address Dr. T.S. Palmer, Department of
Agriculture, Washington.
	</p>
	<p>
According to the standards that have been dragging along previous to
this moment, Wisconsin has a good series of game laws. But the hour
for a Reformation of ideas and principles has struck. We heard it
first in April, 1911. The wild life of America must not be
exterminated according <a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page302] </span> </a> to law, contrary to law, or
in the absence of law! Wisconsin must take a fresh grip on her game
situation, or it will get away from her, after all.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Not another prairie chicken or woodcock should be killed in Wisconsin between 1912 and 1922. When any small bird becomes so scarce that the bag limit needs to be cut down to five, as it now is for the above in Wisconsin, it is time to stop for ten years, before it is too late.
		</li>
		<li>
			Wisconsin should immediately busy herself about the creation of bird and game preserves.
		</li>
		<li>
			For goodness sake, Wisconsin, stop killing squirrels as "game!" You ought to know better&mdash;and you do! Leave that form of barbarism for the Benighted States.
		</li>
		<li>
			And pass a law shutting out the machine guns. They are a disgrace to our country, and a scourge to our game. Continually are they leading good men astray.
		</li>
		<li>
			Extend the term of your State Warden to four years.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="name"> Wyoming: </span>
	<p>
The State of Wyoming once had a magnificent heritage of game. It
embraced the Rocky Mountain species, and also those of the great
plains. First and last, the state has worked hard to protect her
wild life, and hold the killing of it down to a decent basis.
	</p>
	<p>
As far back as 1889, I met on the Shoshone River a very wide-awake
warden, actually "on his job," who was maintained by a body of
private citizens headed by Col. Pickett and known as the Northern
Wyoming Game Protective Association. And even then we saw that the
laws were too liberal for the game. In one man's cold-storage
dug-out we saw enough sheep, deer and elk meat to subsist a company
of hungry dragoons, all killed and possessed according to law.
	</p>
	<p>
In the protection of her mountain game, Wyoming has had a hard task.
In the Yellowstone Park between 1889 and 1894, the poachers for the
taxidermists of Livingston and elsewhere slaughtered 270 bison out
of 300; and Howell was the only man caught. England can protect game
in far-distant mountains and wildernesses; but America can
not,&mdash;or at least <i> we don't! </i> With us, men living in
remote places who find wild game about them say "To h--- with the
law!" They kill on the sly, in season and out of season, females and
males; and the average local jury simply <i> will not </i> convict
the average settler who is accused of such a trifling indiscretion
as killing game out of season when he "needs the meat."
	</p>
	<p>
And so, with laws in full force protecting females, the volume of
big game steadily disappears, <i> everywhere west of the Alleghanies
where the law permits big-game hunting! </i> An interesting chapter
might be written on game exterminated according to law.
	</p>
	<p>
The deadly defects in the protection of western big game are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Structural weakness in the enforcement of the laws;
		</li>
		<li>
			Collusion between offenders for the suppression of evidence;
		</li>
		<li>
			Perjury on the witness stand;
		</li>
		<li>
			Dishonesty and disloyalty on the part of local jurors when friends, are on trial;
		</li>
		<li>
			Sympathy of judges for "the poor man" who wants to eat the game to save his cattle and sheep.

		NEED FOR A FEDERAL MIGRATORY BIRD LAW, NO-SALE-OF-GAME LAW, AND OTHERS
	</div>
</div>
<p>
We are assuming that the American people sincerely desire the
adequate protection and increase of bird life, for reasons that are
both sentimental and commercial. Surely every good citizen dislikes
to see millions of dollar's worth of national wealth foolishly
wasted, and he dislikes to pay any unnecessary increased cost of
living. There must be several millions of Americans who feel that
way, and who are disposed to demand a complete revolution in bird
protection.
</p>
<p>
There are four needs of wild bird life that are fundamental, and
that can not be ignored, any more than a builder can ignore the four
cornerstones of his building. Listed in the order of their
importance, they are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		&mdash;<i>The federal protection of all migratory birds. </i>
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;<i>The total suppression of the sale of native wild game</i>.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;<i>The total suppression of spring shooting and of shooting in the breeding season, and </i>
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;<i>Long close seasons for all species that are about to be "shot out</i>."
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the gunners of America wish to have a gameless continent, all
they need do to secure it is to oppose these principles, prevent
their translation into law, and maintain the status quo. If they do
this, then <i> all our best birds are doomed to swift
destruction</i>. Let no man make a mistake on that point. The "open
seasons" and "bag limits" of the United States to-day are just as
deadly as the 5,000,000 sporting guns now in use, and the
700,000,000 annual cartridges. It is only the ignorant or the
vicious who will seriously dispute this statement.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Federal Protection Of Migratory Birds </span> .&mdash;The bill now before Congress for the protection of all migratory birds by the national government is the most important measure ever placed before that body in behalf of wild life. A stranger to this proposition will need to pause for thought in order to grasp its full meaning, and appreciate the magnitude of its influence.
</p>
<p>
The urgent necessity for a law of this nature is due to the utter
inadequacy of the laws that prevail throughout some portions of the
United States concerning the slaughter and preservation of birds.
Any law that is not enforced is a poor law. There is not one state
in the <a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page305] </span> </a> Union, nor a single province in Canada, in
which the game birds, and other birds criminally shot as game, are
not being killed far faster than they are breeding, and thereby
being exterminated.
</p>
<p>
Several states are financially unable to employ a force of salaried
game wardens; and wherever that is true, the door to universal
slaughter is wide open. Let him who questions this take Virginia as
a case in point. A loyal Virginian told me only this year that in
his state the warden system is an ineffective farce, and the game is
not protected, because the wardens can not afford to patrol the
state for nothing.
</p>
<p>
This condition prevails in a number of states, north and south,
especially south. It is my belief that throughout nine-tenths of the
South, the negroes and poor whites are slaughtering birds exactly as
they please. It is the <i> permanent residents </i> of the haunts of
birds and game that are exterminating the wild life.
</p>
<p>
The value of the birds as destroyers of noxious insects, has been
set forth in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII"> Chapter XXIII</a>. Their
total value is enormous&mdash;or it <i> would </i> be if the birds
were alive and here in their normal numbers. To-day there are about
one-tenth as many birds as were alive and working thirty years ago.
During the past thirty years the destruction of our game birds has
been enormous, and the insectivorous birds have greatly decreased.
</p>
<p>
The damages annually inflicted upon the farm, orchard and garden
crops of this country are very great. When a city is destroyed by
earthquake or fire, and $100,000,000 worth of property is swept
away, we are racked with horror and pity; and the cities of America
pour out money like water to relieve the resultant distress. We are
shocked because we can <i> see </i> the flames, the smoke and the
ruins.
</p>
<p>
And yet, we annually endure with perfect equanimity (<i>because we
can not see it</i>?) a loss of nearly $400,000,000 worth of value
that is destroyed by insects. The damage is inflicted silently,
insidiously, without any scare heads or wooden type in the
newspapers, and so we pay the price without protest. We
know&mdash;when we stop to think of it&mdash;that not all this loss
falls upon the producer. We know that every consumer of bread,
cereals, vegetables and fruit <i> pays his share of this loss</i>!
To-day, millions of people are groaning under the "increased cost of
living." The bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds
is directly intended to decrease the cost of living, by preventing
outrageous waste; but of all the persons to whom the needs of that
bill are presented, how many will take the time to promote its quick
passage by direct appeals to their members of Congress? We shall
see.
</p>
<p>
The good that would be accomplished, annually, by the enactment of a
law for the federal protection of all migratory birds is beyond
computation; but it is my belief that within a very few years the
increase in bird life would prevent what is now an annual loss of
$250,000,000. It is beyond the power of man to protect his crops and
fruit and trees as the bird millions would protect them&mdash;if
they were here as they were in 1870. The migratory bird bill is of
vast importance because it would throw the strong arm of federal
protection around 610 species of birds. <a name="Page_306"
id="Page_306"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page306] </span> </a> The
power of Uncle Sam is respected and feared in many places where the
power of the state is ignored.
</p>
<p>
The list of migratory birds includes most of the perching birds; all
the shore birds (<i>great </i> destroyers of bad insects); all the
swifts and swallows; the goat-suckers (whippoorwill and nighthawk);
some of the woodpeckers; most of the rails; pigeons and doves; many
of the hawks; some of the cranes and herons and all the geese, ducks
and swans.
</p>
<p>
A movement for the federal protection of migratory game birds was
proposed to Congress by George Shiras, 3rd, who as a member of the
House in the 58th Congress introduced a bill to secure that end. An
excellent brief on that subject by Mr. Shiras appeared in the
printed hearing on the McLean bill, held on March 6, 1912, page 18.
Omitting the bills introduced in the 59th, 60th and 61st sessions,
mention need be made only of the measures under consideration in the
present Congress. One of these is a bill introduced by
Representative J.W. Weeks, of Massachusetts, and another is the bill
of Representative D.R. Anthony, Jr., of Kansas, of the same purport.
</p>
<p>
Finally, on April 24, 1912, an adequate and entirely reasonable bill
was introduced in the Senate by Senator George P. McLean, of
Connecticut, as No. 6497 (Calendar No. 606). This bill provides
federal protection for <i> all </i> migratory birds, and embraces
all save a very few of the species that are specially destructive to
noxious insects. The bill provides national protection to the
farmer's and fruit-grower's best friends. It is entitled to the
enthusiastic support of 90,000,000 of people, native and alien.
Every producer of farm products and every consumer of them owes it
to himself to write at once to his member of Congress and ask him
(1) to urge the speedy consideration of the bill for the federal
protection of all migratory birds, (2) to vote for it, and (3) to
work for it until it is passed. It matters not which one of the
three bills described finally becomes a law. Will the American
people act rationally about this matter, and protect their own
interests?
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Suppress The Sale Of All Native Wild Game </span> .&mdash;The deadly effect of the commercial slaughter of game and its sale for food is now becoming well understood by the American people. One by one the various state legislatures have been putting up the bars against the exportation or sale of any "game protected by the state." The U.S. Department of Agriculture says, through Henry Oldys, that "free marketing of wild game leads swiftly to extermination;" and it is literally true.
</p>
<p>
Up to March, 1911, it appears that several states prohibited the
sale of game, sixteen states permitted the sale of all unprotected
game, and in eight more there was partial prohibition.
Unfortunately, however, many of these states permitted the sale of
<i> imported </i> game. Now, since it happened to be a fact that the
vast majority of the states prohibit the <i> export </i> of their
game, as well as the sale of it, a very large quantity of such game
as quail, ruffed grouse, snipe, woodcock and shore birds was
illegally shot for the market, exported in defiance both of state <a
name="Page_307" id="Page_307"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page307]
</span> </a> laws and the federal Lacey Act, and sold to the
detriment of the states that produced it. In other words, in the
laws of each state that merely sought to protect <i> their own </i>
game, regardless of the game of neighboring states, there was not
merely a loop-hole, but there was a gap wide enough to drive through
with a coach and four. The ruffed grouse of Massachusetts and
Connecticut often were butchered to make Gotham holidays in joyous
contempt of the laws at both ends of the line. As a natural result
the game of the Atlantic coast was disappearing at a frightful rate.

	EIGHTEEN STATES ENTIRELY PROHIBIT THE SALE OF GAME WHY DO THE OTHERS LAG BEHIND?
</p>
<p>
In 1911, the no-sale-of-game law of New York was born out of sheer
desperation. The Army of Destruction went up to Albany
well-organized, well provided with money and attorneys, with three
senators in the Senate and two assemblymen in the lower house, to
wage merciless warfare on the whole wild-life cause. The market
gunners and game dealers not only proposed to repeal the law against
spring shooting but also to defeat all legislation that might be
attempted to restrict the sale of game, or impose bag limits on wild
fowl. The Milliners' Association proposed to wipe off the books the
Dutcher law against the use of the plumage of wild birds in
millinery, and an assemblyman was committed to that cause as its
special champion.
</p>
<p>
Then it was that all the friends of wild life in the Empire State
resolved upon a death grapple with the Destroyers, and a fight to an
absolute finish. The Bayne bill, entirely prohibiting the sale of
all native wild game throughout the state of New York, was drafted
and <a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page308] </span> </a> thrown into the ring, and the struggle
began. At first the no-sale-of-game bill looked like sheer madness,
but no sooner was it fairly launched than supporters came flocking
in from every side. All the organizations of sportsmen and friends
of wild life combined in one mighty army, the strength of which was
irresistible. The real sportsmen of the state quickly realized that
the no-sale bill was <i> directly in the interest of legitimate
sport</i>. The great mass of people who love wild life, and never
kill, were quick to comprehend the far-reaching importance of the
measure, and they supported it, with money and enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
The members of the legislature received thousands of letters from
their constituents, asking them to support the Bayne-Blauvelt bill.
They did so. On its passage through the two houses, only <i> one
</i> vote was recorded against it! Incidentally, every move
attempted by the Army of Destruction was defeated and in the final
summing up the defeat amounted to an utter rout.
</p>
<p>
In 1912, after a tremendous struggle, the legislature of
Massachusetts passed a counterpart of the Bayne law, and took her
place in the front rank of states. That was a great fight. The
market-gunners of Cape Cod, the game dealers and other interests
entered the struggle with men in the lower house of the legislature
specially elected to look after their interests. Just as in New York
in 1911, they proposed to repeal the existing laws against spring
shooting and throw the markets wide open to the sale of game. From
first to last, through three long and stormy months, the Destroyers
fought with a degree of determination and persistence worthy of a
better cause. They contested with the Defenders every inch of
ground. In New York, the Destroyers were overwhelmed by the tidal
wave of Defenders, but in Massachusetts it was a prolonged
hand-to-hand fight on the ramparts. <i> Five times </i> was a bill
to repeal the spring-shooting law introduced and defeated!
</p>
<p>
Even after the bill had passed both houses by good majorities, the
Governor declared that he could not sign it. And then there poured
into the Executive offices such a flood of callers, letters,
telegrams and telephone calls that he became convinced that the
People desired the law; so he signed the bill in deference to the
wishes of the majority.
</p>
<p>
The principle that the sale of game is wrong, and fatal to the
existence of a supply of game, is as fixed and unassailable as the
Rocky Mountains. Its universal acceptance is only a question of
intelligence and common honesty. The open states owe it to
themselves and each other to enact both the spirit and the letter of
the Bayne law, <i> and do it quickly</i>, before it is too late to
profit by it! Let them remember the heath hen,&mdash;amply protected
when entirely too late to save it from extinction!
</p>
<p>
It is fairly beyond question that the killing of wild game for the
market, and its sale in the "open season" <i> and out of it</i>, is
responsible for the disappearance of at least fifty per cent of our
stock of American feathered game. It is the market-gunner, the
game-hog who shoots "for sport" and sells his game, and the game
dealer, who have swept away the wild ducks, the ruffed grouse, the
quail and the prairie <a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page309] </span> </a> chickens that thirty years
ago were abundant on their natural ranges. The foolish farmers of
the middle West permitted the market-hunters of Chicago and the East
to slaughter their own legitimate game by the barrel and the
car-load, and ship it "East," to market. To-day the waters of
Currituck Sound are a wholesale slaughter-place for migratory wild
fowl with which to supply the markets of Baltimore, Washington and
Philadelphia. Furthermore, the market gunners of Currituck are
robbing the people of 16 states of tens of thousands of wild-fowl
that legitimately belong to them, during the annual autumn flight.
The accompanying map shows how it is done.

All our feathered game is rapidly slipping away from us. <i> Are we
going to save anything from the wreck</i>? Will we so weakly manage
the game situation that later on there will be no legitimate
bird-shooting for our younger sons, and our grandsons?
</p>
<p>
All laws that permit the killing of game for the market, and the
sale of it afterward, are class legislation of the worst sort. They
permit a hundred men selfishly to slaughter for their own pockets
the game that rightfully belongs to a hundred thousand men and boys
who shoot for the legitimate recreation that such field sports
afford. Will any of the sportsmen of America "stand for" this until
the game is <i> all </i> gone?
</p>
<p>
The people who pay big prices for game in the hotels and restaurants
of our big cities are not men who <i> need </i> that game as food.
Far from it. They can obtain scores of fine meat dishes without
destroying the wild flocks. In civilized countries wild game is no
longer necessary as "food," to satisfy hunger, and ward off
starvation. In the United States the day of the hungry
Indian-fighting pioneer has gone by and there is an abundance of
food everywhere.
</p>
<p>
The time to temporize and feel timid over the game situation has
gone by. The situation is desperate; and nothing but strong and
vigorous measures will avail anything worth while. The sale of all
wild game should be stopped, everywhere and at all seasons,
throughout all North America, and throughout the world. To-day this
particular curse is being felt even in India.
</p>
<p>
It is the duty of every true sportsman, every farmer who owns a gun,
and every lover of wild life, to enter into the campaign for the
passage of bills absolutely prohibiting all traffic in wild game no
matter what its origin. Of course the market hunters, the game-hogs
and the game dealers will bitterly oppose them, and hire a lobby to
attempt to defeat them. But the fight for no-sale-of-game is now on,
and it must not stop short of complete victory.
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<div class="centerheading">
	Reasons Why The Sale Of Wild Game Should Cease Everywhere
</div>
<ol>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because fully 95 per cent of our legitimate stock of feathered game has already been destroyed.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because if market-gunning and the sale of game continue ten years longer, all our feathered game will be swept away. <a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page311]</span> </a>
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because when the sale of game was permitted one dealer was able to sell 1,000,000 <i> game birds per year in New York City</i>, so he himself said.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because it is a fixed fact that every wild species of mammal, bird or reptile that is pursued for money-making purposes eventually is wiped out of existence. Even the whales of the sea are no exception.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because at least 50 per cent of the decrease in our feathered game is due to market-gunning, and the sale of game. Look at the prairie chicken of the Mississippi Valley, and the ruffed grouse of New England.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because the laws that permit the commercial slaughter of wild birds for the benefit of less than five per cent of the inhabitants of any state are directly against the interest of the 95 per cent of other people, to <i> whom that game partly belongs</i>.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because game killed "for sale" is not intended to satisfy "hunger." The people who eat game in large cities do not know what hunger is, save by hearsay. Purchased game is used chiefly in over-feeding; and as a rule it does far more harm than good.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because the greatest value to be derived from any game bird is in seeing it, and photographing it, and enjoying its living company in its native haunts. Who will love the forests when they become destitute of wild life, and desolate?
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because stopping the sale of game <i> will help bring back the game birds to us, in a few years</i>.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because the pace that New York and Massachusetts have set in this matter will render it easier to procure the passage of Bayne laws in other states.
	</li>
	<li>
		&mdash;Because those who legitimately desire game for their tables can be supplied from the game farms and preserves that now are coming into existence.

They represented the last slaughterings of American game for New
York. To-day the remaining plague-spots are Chicago, Philadelphia,
San Francisco, Baltimore, Washington and New Orleans; but in New
Orleans the brakes have at last (1912) been applied, and the market
slaughter that formerly prevailed in that state has at least been
checked.
</p>
<p>
As an instance of persistent market shooting on the greatest ducking
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page312]
</span> </a> waters of the eastern United States, I offer this
report from a trustworthy agent sent to Currituck Sound, North
Carolina, in March, 1911.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
I beg to submit the following information relative to the number of
wild ducks and geese shipped from this market and killed in the
waters of Back Bay and the upper or north end of Currituck Sound,
from October 20th to March 1st, inclusive.
	</p>
	<p>
Approximately there were killed and shipped in the territory above
named, 130,000 to 135,000 wild ducks and between 1400 and 1500 wild
geese. From Currituck Sound and its tributaries there were shipped
approximately 200,000 wild ducks.
	</p>
	<p>
You will see from the above figures that each year the market
shooter exacts a tremendous toll from the wild water fowl in these
waters, and it is only a question of a short time when the wild duck
will be exterminated, unless we can stop the ruthless slaughter. The
last few years I have noted a great decrease in the number of wild
ducks; some of the species are practically extinct. I have secured
the above information from a most reliable source, and the figures
given approximately cannot be questioned.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The effect of the passage of the Bayne law, closing the greatest
American market against the sale of game was an immediate decrease
of fully fifty per cent in the number of ducks and geese slaughtered
on Currituck Sound. The dealers refused to buy the birds, and
one-half the killers were compelled to hang up their guns and go to
work. The duck-slaughterers felt very much enraged by the passage of
the law, and at first were inclined to blame the northern members of
Currituck ducking clubs for the passage of the measure; but as a
matter of fact, not one of the persons blamed took any part whatever
in the campaign for the new law.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Unfairness Of Spring Shooting. </span> &mdash;The shooting of game birds in late winter and spring is to be mentioned only to be condemned. It is grossly unfair to the birds, outrageous in principle, and most unsportsmanlike, no matter whether the law permits it or not. Why it is that any state like Iowa, for example, can go on killing game in spring is more than I can understand. I have endeavored to find a reason for it, in Iowa, but the only real reason is:&mdash;"The boys want the birds!"
</p>
<p>
I think we have at last reached the point where it may truthfully be
said that now no gentleman shoots birds in spring. If the plea is
made that "if we don't shoot ducks in the spring we can't shoot them
at all!" then the answer is&mdash;if you can't shoot game like
high-minded, red-blooded sportsman, <i> don't shoot it at all</i>! A
gentleman can not afford to barter his standing and his own
self-respect for a few ducks shot in the spring when the birds are
going north to lay their eggs. And the man who insists on shooting
in spring may just as well go right on and do various other things
that are beyond the pale, such as shoot quail on the ground, shoot
does and fawns, and fish for trout with gang hooks.
</p>
<p>
There are no longer two sides to what once was the spring shooting
question. Even among savages, the breeding period of the wild
creatures is under taboo. Then if ever may the beasts and birds cry
"King's excuse!" It has been positively stated in print that
high-class fox hounds have been known to refuse to chase a pregnant
fox, even when in full view.

The most charming trait of wild-life character is the alacrity and
confidence with which wild birds and mammals respond to the friendly
advances of human friends. Those who are not very familiar with the
mental traits of our wild neighbors may at first find it difficult
to comprehend the marvelous celerity with which both birds and
mammals recognize friendly overtures from man, and respond to them.
</p>
<p>
At the present juncture, this state of the wild-animal mind becomes
a factor of great importance in determining what we can do to
prevent the extermination of species, and to promote the increase
and return of wild life.
</p>
<p>
I think that there is not a single wild mammal or bird species now
living that can not, or does not, quickly recognize protection, <i>
and take advantage of it</i>. The most conspicuous of all familiar
examples are the wild animals of the Yellowstone Park. They embrace
the elk, mountain sheep, antelope, mule deer, the black bear and
even the grizzly. No one can say precisely how long those several
species were in ascertaining that it was safe to trust themselves
within easy rifle-shot of man; but I think it was about five years.
Birds recognize protection far more quickly than mammals. In a
comparatively short time the naturally wild and wary big game of the
Yellowstone Park became about as tame as range cattle. It was at
least fifteen years ago that the mule deer began to frequent the
parade ground at the Mammoth Hot Springs military post, and receive
there their rations of hay.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you see a beautiful photograph of a large band of big-horn
sheep or mule deer taken at short range amid Rocky Mountain scenery,
you are safe in labeling it as having come from the Yellowstone
Park. The prong-horned antelope herd is so tame that it is difficult
to keep it out of the streets of Gardiner, on the Montana side of
the line.
</p>
<p>
But the bears! Who has not heard the story of the bears of the
Yellowstone Park,&mdash;how black bears and grizzlies stalk out of
the woods, every day, to the garbage dumping-ground; how black bears
actually have come <i> into the hotels </i> for food, without
breaking the truce, and how the grizzlies boldly raid the
grub-wagons and cook-tents of campers, taking just what they please,
because they <i> know </i> that no man dares to shoot them! Indeed,
those raiding bears long ago became a public nuisance, and many of
them have been caught in steel box-traps and shipped to zoological
gardens, in order to get them out of the way. And yet, outside the
Park boundaries, everywhere, the bears are as wary and wild as the
wildest.
</p>
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page314] </span> </a>
<p>
The arrogance of the bears that couldn't be shot once led to a droll
and also exciting episode.
</p>
<p>
During the period when Mr. C.J. Jones ("Buffalo" Jones) was
superintendent of the wild animals of the Park, the indignities
inflicted upon tourist campers by certain grizzly bears quite
abraded his nerves. He obtained from Major Pitcher authority to
punish and reform a certain grizzly, and went about the matter in a
thoroughly Buffalo-Jonesian manner. He procured a strong lariat and
a bean-pole seven feet long and repaired to the camp that was
troubled by too much grizzly.
</p>
<p>
The particular offender was a full-grown male grizzly who had become
a notorious raider. At the psychological moment Jones lassoed him in
short order, getting a firm hold on the bear's left hind leg.
Quickly the end of the rope was thrown over a limb of the nearest
tree, and in a trice Ephraim found himself swinging head downward
between the heavens and the earth. And then his punishment began.
</p>
<p>
Buffalo Jones thrashed him soundly with the bean-pole! The outraged
bear swung to and fro, whirled round and round, clawing and snapping
at the empty air, roaring and bawling with rage, scourged in flesh
and insulted in spirit. As he swung, the bean-pole searched out the
different parts of his anatomy with a wonderful degree of neatness
and precision. Between rage and indignation the grizzly nearly
exploded. A moving-picture camera was there, and since that day that
truly moving scene has amazed and thrilled countless thousands of
people.
</p>
<p>
When it was over, Mr. Jones boldly turned the bear loose! Although
its rage was as boundless as the glories of the Yellowstone Park, it
paused not to rend any of those present, but headed for the tall
timber, and with many an indignant "Woof! Woof!" it plunged in and
disappeared. It was two or three years before that locality was
again troubled by impudent grizzly bears.
</p>
<p>
And what is the mental attitude of <i> every </i> Rocky Mountain
black or grizzly bear <i> outside </i> of the Yellowstone Park? It
is colossal suspicion of man, perpetual fear, and a clean pair of
heels the moment man-scent or man-sight proclaims the proximity of
the Arch Enemy of Wild Creatures. And yet there are one or two men
who tell the American public that wild animals do not think, that
they do not reason, and are governed only by "instinct"!

	<span class="title"> Taming Wild Birds. </span> &mdash;As incontestable proof of the receptive faculties of birds, I will cite the taming of wild birds in the open, by friendly advances. There are hundreds, aye, thousands, of men, women, boys and girls who could give interesting and valuable personal testimony on this point.
</p>
<p>
My friend J. Alden Loring (one of the naturalists of the Roosevelt
African Expedition), is an ardent lover of wild birds and mammals.
The taming of wild creatures in the open is one of his pastimes, and
his results serve well to illustrate the marvelous readiness of our
wild <a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page315] </span> </a> neighbors to become close friends with man
<i> when protected</i>. I will quote from one of Mr. Loring's
letters on this subject:
</p>
<p>
"Taming wild birds is a new field in nature study, and one never can
tell what success he will have until he has experimented with
different species. Some birds tame much more easily than others. On
three or four occasions I have enticed a chickadee <i> to my hand
</i> at the first attempt, while in other cases it has taken from
fifteen minutes to a whole day.
</p>
<p>
"Chipping sparrows that frequent my doorway I have tamed in two
days. A nuthatch required three hours before it would fly to my
hand, although it took food from my stick the first time it was
offered. When you find a bird on her nest, it is of course much
easier to tame that individual than if you had to follow it about in
the open, and wait for it to come within reach of a stick. By
exercising extreme caution, and approaching inch by inch, I have
climbed a tree to the nest of a yellow-throated vireo, and at the
first attempt handed the bird a meal-worm with my fingers. At one
time I had two house wrens, a yellow-throated vireo, a chipping
sparrow and a flock of chickadees that would come to my hand."

It would be possible&mdash;and also delightful&mdash;to fill a
volume with citations of evidence to illustrate the quick acceptance
of man's protection by wild birds and mammals. Let me draw a few
illustrations from my own wild neighbors.
</p>
<p>
On Lake Agassiz, in the N.Y. Zoological Park, within 500 feet of my
office in the Administration Building, a pair of wild wood-ducks
made <a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page316] </span> </a> their nest last spring, and have just
finished rearing nine fine, healthy young birds. Whenever you see a
wood-duck rise and fly in our Park, you may know that it is a wild
bird. During the summer of 1912 a small flock of wild wood-ducks
came every night to our Wild-Fowl Pond, and spent the night there.
</p>
<p>
A year ago, a covey of eleven quail appeared in the Park, and have
persistently remained ever since. Last fall and winter they came at
least twenty times to a spot within forty feet of the rear window of
my office, in order to feed upon the wheat screenings that we placed
there for them.
</p>
<p>
When we first occupied the Zoological Park grounds, in 1899, there
was not one wild rabbit in the whole 264 acres. Presently the
species appeared, and rabbits began to hop about confidently, all
over the place. In 1906, we estimated that there were about eighty
individuals. Then the marauding cats began to come in, and they
killed off the rabbits until not one was to be seen. Thereupon, we
addressed ourselves to those cats, in more serious earnest than ever
before. Now the cats have disappeared; and one day last spring, as I
left my office at six o'clock, everyone else having previously gone,
I almost stepped upon two half-grown bunnies that had been visiting
on the front door-mat.
</p>
<p>
When we were macadamizing the yards around the Elephant House, with
a throng of workmen all about every day, a robin made its nest on
the heavy channel-iron frame of one of the large elephant gates that
swung to and fro nearly every day.
</p>
<p>
In 1900 we planted a young pine tree in front of our temporary
office building, within six feet of a main walk; and at once a pair
of robins nested in it and reared young there.

<p>
Up in Putnam County, where for five years deer have been protected,
the exhibitions that are given each year of the supreme confidence
of protected deer literally astonish the natives. They are almost
unafraid of man and his vehicles, his cattle and his horses, but of
course they are unwilling to be handled. Strangers are astonished;
but people who know something about the mental attitude of wild
animals under protection know that it is the natural and inevitable
result of <i> real protection</i>.
</p>
<p>
At Mr. Frank Seaman's summer home in the Catskills, the phoebe birds
nest on the beams under the roof of the porch. At my summer home in
the Berkshires, no sooner was our garage completed than a phoebe
built her nest on the edge of the lintel over the side door; and
another built on a drain-pipe over the kitchen door.

Near Port Jervis, last year a wild ruffed grouse nested and reared a

On the Bull River in the wilds of British Columbia two trappers of
my acquaintance, Mack Norboe and Charlie Smith, once formed a
friendship with a wild weasel. In a very few visits, the weasel
found that it was among friends, and the trappers' log cabin became
its home. I have a photograph of it, taken while it posed on the
door-sill. The trappers said that often when returning at nightfall
from their trap-lines, the weasel would meet them a hundred yards
away on the trail, and follow them back to the cabin.

	<span class="title"> An Object Lesson In Protection. </span> &mdash;A remarkable object lesson in the <a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page318] </span> </a> recognition of protection by wild ducks came under my notice in the pages of "Recreation Magazine" in June, 1903, when that publication was edited by G.O. Shields. The article was entitled,&mdash;" A Haven of Refuge," and the place described well deserved the name. It is impossible for me to impress upon the readers of this volume with sufficient force and clearness the splendid success that is easily attainable in encouraging the return of the birds. The story of the Mosca "Haven of Refuge" was so well told by Mr. Charles C. Townsend in the publication referred to above, that I take pleasure in reproducing it entire.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
One mile north of the little village of Mosca, Colorado, in San Luis
valley, lives the family of J.C. Gray. On the Gray ranch there is an
artesian well which empties into a small pond about 100 feet square.
This pond is never entirely frozen over and the water emptying
therein is warm even during the coldest winter.
	</p>
	<p>
Some five years ago, Mr. Gray secured a few wild-duck eggs, and
hatched them under a hen. The little ducks were reared and fed on
the little pond. The following spring they left the place, to return
in the fall, bringing with them broods of young; also bringing other
ducks to the home where protection was afforded them, and plenty of
good feed was provided. Each year since, the ducks have scattered in
the spring to mate and rear their families, returning again with
greatly increased numbers in the fall, and again bringing strangers
to the haven of refuge.
	</p>
	<p>
I drove out to the ranch November 24, 1902, and found the little
pond almost black with the birds, and was fortunate enough to secure
a picture of a part of the pond while the ducks were thickly
gathered thereon. Ice had formed around the edges, and this ice was
covered with ducks. The water was also alive with others, which paid
not the least attention to the party of strangers on the shore.
	</p>
	<p>
From Mr. Gray I learned that there were some 600 ducks of various
kinds on the pond at that time, though it was then early for them to
seek winter quarters. Later in the year, he assured me, there would
be between 2,000 and 3,000 teal, mallards, canvas-backs, redheads
and other varieties, all perfectly at home and fearless of danger.
The family have habitually approached the pond from the house, which
stands on the south side, and should any person appear on the north
side of the pond the ducks immediately take fright and flight. Wheat
was strewn on the ground and in the water, and the ducks waddled
around us within a few inches of our feet to feed, paying not the
least attention to us, or to the old house-dog which walked near.
	</p>
	<p>
Six miles east of the ranch is San Luis lake, to which these ducks
travel almost daily while the lake is open. When they are at the
lake it is impossible to approach within gunshot of the then timid
birds. Some unsympathetic boys and men have learned the habit of the
birds, and place themselves in hiding along the course of flight to
and from the lake. Many ducks are shot in this way, but woe to the
person caught firing a gun on or near the home-pond. When away from
home, the birds are as other wild-ducks and fail to recognize any
members of the Gray family. While at home they follow the boys
around the barn-yard, squawking for feed like so many tame ducks.
	</p>
	<p>
This is the greatest sight I have ever witnessed, and one that I
could not believe existed until I had seen it. Certainly it is worth
travelling many miles to see, and no one, after seeing it, would
care to shoot birds that, when kindly treated, make such charming
pets.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Since the above was published, the protected flocks of tame wild
ducks have become one of the most interesting sights of Florida. At
Palm Beach the tameness of the wild ducks when within their
protected area, and their wildness outside of it, has been witnessed
by thousands of visitors.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Saving Of The Snowy Egret In The United States. </span> &mdash;The time was when <a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page319] </span> </a> very many persons believed that the devastations of the plume-hunters of Florida and the Gulf Coast would be so long continued and so persistently followed up to the logical conclusion that both species of plume-furnishing egrets would disappear from the avifauna of the United States. This expectation gave rise to feelings of resentment, indignation and despair.
</p>
<p>
It happened, however, that almost at the last moment a solitary
individual set on foot an enterprise calculated to preserve the
snowy egret (which is the smaller of the two species involved), from
final extermination. The splendid success that has attended the
efforts of Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny, of Avery Island, Louisiana, is
entitled not only to admiration and praise, but also to the higher
tribute of practical imitation. Mr. McIlhenny is, first of all, a
lover of birds, and a humanitarian. He has traveled widely
throughout the continent of North America and elsewhere, and has
seen much of wild life and man's influence upon it. To-day his
highest ambition is to create for the benefit of the Present, and as
a heritage to Posterity, a mid-continental chain of great bird
refuges, in which migrating wild fowl and birds of all other species
may find resting-places and refuges during their migrations, and
protected feeding-grounds in winter. In this grand enterprise, the
consummation of which is now in progress, Mr. McIlhenny is
associated with Mr. Charles Willis Ward, joint donor of the splendid
Ward-McIlhenny Bird Preserve of 13,000 acres, which recently was
presented to the State of Louisiana by its former owners.
</p>
<p>
The egret and heron preserve, however, is Mr. McIlhenny's individual
enterprise, and really furnished the motif of the larger movement.
Of its inception and development, he has kindly furnished me the
following account, accompanied by many beautiful photographs of
egrets breeding in sanctuary, one of which appears on page 27.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
In some recent publications I have seen statements to the effect
that you believed the egrets were nearing extinction, owing to the
persecution of plume hunters, so I know that you will be interested
in the enclosed photographs, which were taken in my heron rookery,
situated within 100 yards of my factory, where I am now sitting
dictating this letter.
	</p>
	<p>
This rookery was started by me in 1896, because I saw at that time
that the herons of Louisiana were being rapidly exterminated by
plume hunters. My thought was that the way to preserve them would be
to start an artificial rookery of them where they could be
thoroughly protected. With this end in view I built a small pond,
taking in a wet space that contained a few willows and other shrubs
which grow in wet places.
	</p>
	<p>
In a large cage in this pond, I raised some snowy herons. After
keeping the birds in confinement for something over six months I
turned them loose, hoping that they would come back the next season,
as they were perfectly tame and were used to seeing people. I was
rewarded the next season by four of the birds returning, and nesting
in the willows in the pond. This was the start of a rookery that now
covers 35 acres, and contains more than twenty thousand pairs of
nesting birds, embracing not only the egrets but all the species of
herons found in Louisiana, besides many other water birds.
	</p>
	<p>
With a view to carrying on the preservation of our birds on a larger
scale, Mr. Chas. W. Ward and I have recently donated to the State of
Louisiana 13,000 acres of what I consider to be the finest wild fowl
feeding ground on the Louisiana coast, as it contains the only
gravel beach for 50 miles, and all of the geese within that space
come daily to this beach for gravel. This territory also produces a
great amount of natural food for geese and ducks.

	<span class="title"> Saving The Gulls And Terns. </span> &mdash;But for the vigorous and long-continued efforts of the Audubon Societies, I think our coasts would by this time have been swept clean of the gulls and terns that now adorn it. Twenty years ago the milliners were determined to have them all. The fight for them was long, and hotly contested, but the Audubon Societies won. It was a great victory, and has yielded results of great value to the country at large. And yet, it was only a small number of persons who furnished the money and made the fight which inured to the benefit of the millions of American people. Hereafter, whenever you see an American gull or tern, remind yourself that it was saved to the nation by "the Audubon people."
</p>
<p>
In times of grave emergency, such as fire, war and scarcity of food,
the wild creatures forget their fear of man, and many times actually
surrender themselves to his mercy and protection. At such times,
hard is the heart and low is the code of manly honor that does not
respond in a manner becoming a superior species.
</p>
<p>
The most pathetic wild-animal situation ever seen in the United
States on a large scale is that which for six winters in succession
forced several thousand starving elk into the settlement of Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, in quest of food at the hands of their natural
enemies. The elk lost all fear, partly because they were not
attacked, and they surrounded the log-enclosed haystacks, barns and
houses, mutely begging for food. Previous to the winter of 1911,
thousands of weak calves and cows perished around the haystacks. Mr.
S.N. Leek's wonderful pictures tell a thrilling but very sad story.
</p>
<p>
To the everlasting honor of the people of Jackson Hole, be it
recorded that they rose like Men to the occasion that confronted
them. In 1909 they gave to the elk herds all the hay that their
domestic stock could spare, not pausing to ascertain whether they
ever would be reimbursed for it. They just handed it out! The
famishing animals literally mobbed the hay-wagons. To-day the
national government has the situation in hand.
</p>
<p>
In times of peace and plenty, the people of Jackson Hole take their
toll of the elk herds, but their example during starvation periods
is to be commended to all men.

	<span class="title"> A Slaughter Of Restored Game. </span> &mdash;The case of the chamois in Switzerland teaches the world a valuable lesson in how <i> not </i> to slaughter game that has come back to its haunts through protected breeding.
</p>
<p>
A few years ago, one of the provinces of Switzerland took note of
the fact that its once-abundant stock of chamois was almost extinct,
and enacted a law by which the remnant was absolutely protected for
a long period. During those years of protection, the animals bred
and multiplied, until finally the original number was almost
restored.
</p>
<p>
Then,&mdash;as always in such cases,&mdash;there arose a strong
demand for an open season; and eventually the government yielded to
the pressure of the hunters, and fixed a date whereon an open season
should begin.

<p>
During the period preceding that fatal date, the living chamois,
grown half tame by years of immunity from the guns, were all
carefully located and marked down by those who intended to hunt
them. At daybreak on the fatal day, the onset began. Guns and
hunters were everywhere, and the mountains resounded with the
fusillade. Hundreds of chamois were slain, by hundreds of hunters;
and by the close of that fatal "open season" the species was more
nearly exterminated throughout that region than ever before. Once
more those mountains were nice and barren of game.
</p>
<p>
Let that bloody and disgraceful episode serve as a warning to
Americans who are tempted to demand an open season on game that has
bred back from the verge of extinction. Particularly do we commend
it to the notice of the people of Colorado who <i> even now </i> are
demanding an open season on the preserved mountain sheep of that
state. The granting of such an open season would be a brutal
outrage. Those sheep are now so tame and unsuspicious that the
killing of them would be <i> cold-blooded murder! </i>
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Logical Conclusion. </span> &mdash;Within reasonable limits, any partly-destroyed wild species can be increased and brought back by giving absolute protection from harassment and slaughter. When a species is struggling to recuperate, it deserves to be left <i> entirely unmolested </i> until it is once more on safe ground.
</p>
<p>
Every breeding wild animal craves seclusion and entire immunity from
excitement and all forms of molestation. Nature simply demands this
as her unassailable right. It is my firm belief that any wild
species will breed in captivity whenever its members are given a
degree of seclusion that they deem satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
With species that have not been shot down to a point entirely too
low, adequate protection generously long in duration will bring back
their numbers. If the people of the United States so willed it, we
could have wild white-tailed deer in every state and in every county
(save city counties) between the Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains.
We could easily have one thousand bob white quail for every one now
living. We could have squirrels in every grove, and songbirds by the
million,&mdash;merely by protecting them from slaughter and
molestation. From Ohio to the great plains, the pinnated grouse
could be made far more common than crows and blackbirds.
</p>
<p>
Inasmuch as all this is true,&mdash;and no one with information will
dispute it for a moment,&mdash;is it not folly to seek to supplant
our own splendid native species of game birds (<i>that we never yet
have decently protected!</i>) with foreign species? Let the American
people answer this question with "Yes" or "No."
</p>
<p>
The methods by which our non-game birds can be encouraged and
brought back are very simple: Protect them, put up shelters for
them, give them nest-boxes in abundance, protect them from cats,
dogs, and all other forms of destruction, and feed those that need
to be fed. I should think <a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page323] </span> </a> that every boy living in
the country would find keen pleasure in making and erecting
nest-boxes for martins, wrens, and squirrels; in putting up straw
teepees in winter for the quail, in feeding the quail, and in
nailing to the trees chunks of suet and fat pork every winter for
the woodpeckers, nuthatches, and other winter residents.
</p>
<p>
Will any person now on this earth live long enough to see the
present all-pervading and devilish spirit of slaughter so replaced
by the love of wild creatures and the true spirit of conservation
that it will be as rare as it now is common?
</p>
<p>
But let no one think for a moment that any vanishing species can at
any time be brought back; for that would be a grave error. The point
is always reached, by every such species, that the survivors are too
few to cope with circumstances, and recovery is impossible. The
heath hen could not be brought back, neither could the passenger
pigeon. The whooping crane, the sage grouse, the trumpeter swan, the
wild turkey, and the upland plover never will come back to us, and
nothing that we can do ever will bring them back. Circumstances are
against those species,&mdash;and I fear against many others also.
Thanks to the fact that the American bison breeds well in captivity,
we have saved that species from complete extinction, but our
antelope seems to be doomed.
</p>
<p>
It is because of the alarming condition of our best wild life that
quick action and strong action is vitally necessary. We are sleeping
on our possibilities.

	<div class="subtitle">
		INTRODUCED SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL
	</div>
</div>
<p>
Man has made numerous experiments in the transplantation of wild
species of mammals and birds from one country, or continent, to
another. About one-half these efforts have been beneficial, and the
other half have resulted disastrously.
</p>
<p>
The transplantation of any wild-animal species is a leap in the
dark. On general principles it is dangerous to meddle with the laws
of Nature, and attempt to improve upon the code of the wilderness.
Our best wisdom in such matters may easily prove to be short-sighted
folly. The trouble lies in the fact that concerning transplantation
it is <i> impossible for us to know beforehand all the conditions
that will affect it, or that it will effect, and how it will work
out</i>. In its own home a species may <i> seem </i> not only
harmless, but actually beneficial to man. We do not know, and <i> we
can not know</i>, all the influences that keep it in check, and that
mould its character. We do not know, and we can not know without a
trial, how new environment will affect it, and what new traits of
character it will develop under radically different conditions. The
gentle dove of Europe may become the tyrant dove of Cathay. The
Repressed Rabbit of the Old World becomes in Australia the
Uncontrollable Rabbit, a devastator and a pest of pests.
</p>
<p>
No wild species should be transplanted and set free in a wild state
to stock new regions without consulting men of wisdom, and following
their advice. It is now against the laws of the United States to
introduce and acclimatize in a wild state, anywhere in the United
States, any wild-bird species without the approval of the Department
of Agriculture. The law is a wise one. Furthermore, the same
principle should apply to birds that it is proposed to transplant
from one portion of the United States into another, especially when
the two are widely separated.
</p>
<p>
On this point, I once learned a valuable lesson, which may well
point my present moral. Incidentally, also, it was a narrow escape
for me!
</p>
<p>
A gentlemen of my acquaintance, who admires the European magpie, and
is well aware of its acceptable residence in various countries in
Europe, once requested my cooperation in securing and acclimatizing
at his country estate a number of birds of that species. As in duty
bound, I laid the matter before our Department of Agriculture, and
asked for an opinion. The Department replied, in effect, "Why import
a foreign magpie when we have in the West a species of our own quite
as handsome, and which could more easily be transplanted?"
</p>
<p>
The point seemed well taken. Now, I had seen much of the American <a
name="Page_325" id="Page_325"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page325]
</span> </a> magpie in its wild home,&mdash;the Rocky Mountains, and
the western border of the Great Plains,&mdash;and I <i> thought </i>
I was acquainted with it. I knew that a few complaints against it
had been made, but they had seemed to me very trivial. To me our
magpie seemed to have a generally unobjectionable record.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately for me, I wrote to Mr. Hershey, Assistant Curator of
Ornithology in the Colorado State Museum, for assistance in
procuring fifty birds, for transplantation to the State of New York.
Mr. Hershey replied that if I really wished the birds for
acclimatization, he would gladly procure them for me; but he said
that in the <i> thickly-settled farming communities </i> of
Colorado, the magpie is now regarded as a pest. It devours the eggs
and nestlings of other wild birds, and not only that, it destroys so
many eggs of domestic poultry that many farmers are compelled to
keep their egg-laying hens shut up in wire enclosures!
</p>
<p>
Now, this condition happened to be entirely unknown to me, because I
never had seen the American magpie in action <i> in a farming
community</i>! Of course the proposed experiment was promptly
abandoned, but it is embarrassing to think how near I came to making
a mistake. Even if the magpies had been transplanted and had become
a nuisance in this state, they could easily have been exterminated
by shooting; but the memory of the error would have been humiliating
to the party of the first part.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Old World Pheasants In America. </span> &mdash;In 1881 the first Chinese ring-necked pheasants were introduced into the United States, twelve miles below Portland, Oregon; twelve males and three females. The next year, Oregon gave pheasants a five-year close season. A little later, the golden and silver pheasants of China were introduced, and all three species throve mightily, on the Pacific Coast, in Oregon, Washington and western British Columbia. In 1900, the sportsmen of Portland and Vancouver were shooting cock golden pheasants according to law.
</p>
<p>
The success of Chinese and Japanese pheasants on the Pacific Coast
soon led to experiments in the more progressive states, at state
expense. State pheasant hatcheries have been established in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois,
Missouri, Iowa and California.
</p>
<p>
In many localities, the old-world pheasants have come to stay. The
rise and progress of the ring-neck in western New York has already
been noted. It came about merely through protection. That protection
was protection in fact, not the false "protection" that shoots on
the sly. It is the irony of fate that full protection should be
accorded a foreign bird, in order that it may multiply and possess
the land, while the same kind of protection is refused the native
bob white, and it is now almost a dead species, so far as this state
is concerned.
</p>
<p>
In looking about for grievances against the ring-necked and English
pheasant, some persons have claimed that in winter these birds are
"budders," which means that they harmfully strip trees and bushes of
the buds that those bushes will surely need in their spring opening.
On <a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page326] </span> </a> that point Dr. Joseph Kalbfus, Secretary of
the Pennsylvania Game Commission, sent out a circular letter of
inquiry, in response to which he received many statements. With but
one exception, all the testimony received was to the effect that
pheasants are <i> not </i> bud-eaters, and that generally the charge
is unfounded.
</p>
<p>
The introduction of old-world pheasants, and the attempted
introduction of the Hungarian partridge, are efforts designed first
of all to furnish sportsmen something to shoot, and incidentally to
provide a new food supply for the table. The people of this country
are not starving, nor are they even very hungry for the meat of
strange birds; but as a food-producer, the pheasant is all right.
</p>
<p>
It disgusts me to the core, however, to see states that wantonly and
wickedly, through sheer apathy and lack of business enterprise, have
allowed the quail, the heath hen, the pinnated grouse and the ruffed
grouse to become almost exterminated by extravagant and foolish
shooters, now putting forth wonderfully diligent efforts and
spending money without end, in introducing <i> foreign </i> species!
Many men actually take the ground that our game "can't live" in its
own country any longer; but only the ignorant and the unthinking
will say so! Give our game birds decent, sensible, <i> actual </i>
protection, stop their being slaughtered far faster than they breed,
and <i> they will live anywhere in their own native haunts</i>! But
where is there <i> one species </i> of upland game bird in America
that has been sensibly and adequately protected? From Portland,
Maine, to Portland, Oregon there is <i> not one,&mdash;not a single
locality in which protection from shooting has been sensible, or
just, or adequate</i>.
</p>
<p>
We have universally given our American upland game birds an unfair
deal, and now we are adding insult to slaughter by bringing in
foreign game birds to replace them&mdash;because our birds "can't
live" before five million shot-guns!
</p>
<p>
Our American game birds CAN live, anywhere in the haunts where
nature placed them that are not to-day actually occupied by cities
and towns! Give me the making of the laws, and I will make the
prairie chicken and quail as numerous throughout the northern states
east of the Great Plains as domestic chickens are outside the
regular poultry farms. There is only one reason why there are not
ten million quail in the state of New York to-day,&mdash;one for
each human inhabitant,&mdash;and that reason is the infernal greed
and selfishness of the men who have almost exterminated our quail by
over-shooting. Don't talk to me about the "hard winters" killing off
our quail! It is the hard cheek of the men who shoot them when they
ought to let them alone.
</p>
<p>
The State of Iowa could support 500,000 prairie chickens and never
miss the waste grain that they would glean in the fields; but now
the prairie chicken is practically extinct in Iowa, only a few
scattered specimens remaining as "last survivors" in some of the
northern counties. The migration of those birds that unexpectedly
came down from the north last winter was like the fall of a
meteor,&mdash;only the birds promptly faded away again. Why should
New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts <a name="Page_327"
id="Page_327"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page327] </span> </a>
exterminate the heath hen and coddle the ring-necked pheasant and
the Hungarian partridge?
</p>
<p>
The introduction of the old-world pheasants interests me very
little. Every one that I see is a painful reminder of our
slaughtered quail and grouse,&mdash;the birds that never have had a
square deal from the American people! Thus far the introduction of
the Hungarian partridge has not been successful, anywhere.
Connecticut, Missouri, New Jersey and I think other states have
tried this, and failed. The failure of that species brings no sorrow
to me. I prefer our own game birds; and if the American people will
not conserve those properly and decently they deserve to have no
game birds.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The European Red Deer In New Zealand. </span> &mdash;Occasionally a gameless land makes a ten-strike by introducing a foreign game animal that does no harm, and becomes of great value. The greatest success ever made in the transplantation of game animals has been in New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
Originally, New Zealand possessed no large animals, and no
"big-game." When Nature passed around the deer, antelopes, sheep,
goats, wild cattle and bears, New Zealand failed to receive her
share. For centuries her splendid forests, her grand mountains and
picturesque valleys remained untenanted by big game.
</p>
<p>
In 1864, the Prince Consort of England caused seven head of European
red deer to be taken from the royal park at Windsor, and sent to
Christchurch, New Zealand. Only three of the animals survived the
long voyage; a buck and two does. For several weeks the two were
kept in a barn in Christchurch, where they served no good purpose,
and were not likely to live long or be happy. Finally some one said,
"Let's set them free in the mountains!"
</p>
<p>
The idea was adopted. The three animals were hauled an uncertain
number of miles into the interior mountains and set free.
</p>
<p>
They promptly settled down in their new home. They began to breed,
and now on the North Island there are probably five thousand
European red deer, every one of which has descended directly from
the famous three! And here is the strangest part of the story:
</p>
<p>
The red deer of the North Island represent the greatest case of
in-and-in breeding of wild animals on record. According to the
experience of the world in the breeding of domestic cattle (<i>not
horses</i>), we should expect physical deterioration, the
development of diseases, and disaster. On the contrary, the usual
evil results of in-breeding in domestic cattle have been totally
absent. <i> The red deer of New Zealand are to-day physically larger
and more robust animals, with longer and heavier antlers, and longer
hair, than any of the red deer of Europe west of Germany</i>!
</p>
<p>
Red deer have been introduced practically all over New Zealand, and
the total number now in the Islands must be somewhere near forty
thousand. The sportsmen of that country have grand sport, and take
many splendid trophies. That transplantation has been a very great
success. <a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page328] </span> </a> Incidentally, the case of the in-bred deer
of the North Island, taken along with other cases of which we know,
establishes a new and important principle in evolution. It is this:
</p>
<p>
<i> When healthy wild animals are established in a state of nature,
either absolutely free, or confined in preserves so large that they
roam at will, seek the food of nature and take care of themselves,
in-and-in breeding produces no ill effects, and ceases to be a
factor. The animals develop in physical perfection according to the
climate and their food supply; and the introduction of new blood is
not necessary</i>.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Fallow Deer On The Island Of Lambay. </span> &mdash;In the Irish Sea, a few miles from the southeast coast of Ireland, is the Island of Lambay, owned by Cecil Baring, Esq. The island is precisely one square mile in area, and some of its sea frontage terminates in perpendicular cliffs. In many ways the island is of unusual interest to zoologists, and its fauna has been well set forth by Mr. Baring.
</p>
<p>
In the year 1892 three fallow deer (<i>Dama vulgaris</i>) a buck and
two does, were transplanted from a park on the Irish mainland to
Lambay, and there set free. From that slender stock has sprung a
large herd, which, but for the many deer that have been purposely
shot, and the really considerable number that have been killed by
going over the cliffs in stormy weather, the progeny of the original
three would to-day number several hundred head. No new blood has
been introduced, and <i> no deer have died of disease</i>. Even
counting out the losses by the rifle and by accidental death, the
herd to-day numbers more than one hundred head.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Baring declares that neither he nor his gamekeeper have ever
been able to discover any deterioration in the deer of Lambay,
either in size, weight, size of antlers, fertility or general
physical stamina. The deterioration through disease, especially
tuberculosis, that always is dreaded and often observed in closely
in-bred domestic cattle, has been totally absent.
</p>
<p>
In looking about for wild species that have been transplanted, and
that have thriven and become beneficial to man, there seems to be
mighty little game in sight! The vast majority belong in the next
chapter. We will venture to mention the bob white quail that were
introduced into Utah in 1871, into Idaho in 1875, and the California
valley quail in Washington in 1857. Wherever these efforts have
succeeded, the results have been beneficial to man.
</p>
<p>
In 1879 a well-organized effort was made to introduce European quail
into several of the New England and Middle States,&mdash;to take the
place of the bob white, we may suppose,&mdash;the bird that "can't
stand the winters!" About three thousand birds were distributed and
set free,&mdash;and went down and out, just as might have been
expected. During the past twenty years it is safe to say that not
less than $500,000 have been expended in the northern states, and
particularly in the northeastern states, in importing live quail
from Kansas, the Indian Territory, Oklahoma, Texas, the Carolinas
and other southern states, for restocking areas from which the
northern bob white had been exterminated by foolish over-shooting! I
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page329]
</span> </a> think that fully nine-tenths of these efforts have
ended in total failure. The quail could not survive in their strange
environment. I cannot recall a <i> single instance </i> in which
restocking northern covers with southern quail has been a success.
</p>
<p>
There is no royal road to the restoration of an exterminated bird
species. Where the native seed still exists, by long labor and
travail, thorough protection and a mighty long close season, it can
be encouraged to <i> breed back and return</i>; but it is an
evolution that can not be hurried in the least. Protect Nature, and
leave the rest to her.
</p>
<p>
With mammals, the case is different. It is possible to restock
depleted areas, provided Time is recognized as a dominant factor. I
can cite two interesting cases by way of illustration, but this
subject will form another chapter.
</p>
<p>
In the transplantation of fishes, conditions are widely different,
and many notable successes have been achieved.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
One of the greatest hits ever made by the United States Bureau of
Fisheries in the planting of fish in new localities was the
introduction of the striped bass or rock-fish (<i>Roccus
lineatus</i>) of our Atlantic coast, into the coast waters of
California. In 1879, 135 live fish were deposited in Karquines
Strait, at Martinez, and in 1882, 300 more were planted in Suisun
Bay, near the first locality chosen.
	</p>
	<p>
Twelve years after the first planting in San Francisco Bay, the
markets of San Francisco handled 149,997 pounds of striped bass. At
that time the average weight for a whole year was eleven pounds, and
the average price was ten cents per pound. Fish weighing as high as
forty-nine pounds have been taken, and there are reasons for the
belief that eventually the fish of California will attain as great
weight as those of the Atlantic and the Gulf.
	</p>
	<p>
The San Francisco markets now sell, annually, about one and one half
million pounds of striped bass. This fish has taken its place among
anglers as one of the game fishes of the California coast, and
affords fine sport. Strange to say, however, it has not yet spread
beyond the shores of California.
	</p>
	<p>
Regarding this species, the records of the United States Bureau of
Fisheries are of interest. In 1897, the California markets handled
2,949,642 pounds, worth $225,527.&mdash;(American Natural History.)
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nowhere else in the world, we venture to say, were such extensive,
costly and persistent efforts put forth in the transplantation of
any wild foreign species as the old U.S. Fish Commission, under
Prof. Spencer F. Baird, put forth in the introduction of the German
carp into the fresh water ponds, lakes and rivers of the United
States. It was held that because the carp could live and thrive in
waters bottomed with mud, that species would be a boon to all inland
regions where bodies of water, or streams, were scarce and dear.
Although the carp is not the best fish in the world for the table,
it seemed that the dwellers in the prairie and great plains regions
would find it far better than bullheads, or no fish at
all,&mdash;which are about the same thing.
</p>
<p>
By means of special fish cars, sent literally all over the United
States, at a great total expense, live carp, hatched in the ponds
near the Washington Monument were distributed to all applicants. The
German carp spread far and wide; but to-day I think the fish has
about as many enemies as friends. In some places, strong objections
have been filed to the manner in which carp stir up the mud at the
bottom of ponds and small lakes, greatly to the detriment of all the
native fishes found therein.

		INTRODUCED SPECIES THAT HAVE BECOME PESTS
	</div>
</div>
<p>
The man who successfully transplants or "introduces" into a new
habitat any persistent species of living thing, assumes a very grave
responsibility. Every introduced species is doubtful gravel until
panned out. The enormous losses that have been inflicted upon the
world through the perpetuation of follies with wild vertebrates and
insects would, if added together, be enough to purchase a
principality. The most aggravating feature of these follies in
transplantation is that never yet have they been made severely
punishable. We are just as careless and easy-going on this point as
we were about the government of the Yellowstone Park in the days
when Howell and other poachers destroyed our first national bison
herd, and when caught red-handed&mdash;as Howell was, skinning seven
Park bison cows,&mdash;<i>could not be punished for it, because
there was no penalty prescribed by any law</i>.
</p>
<p>
To-day, there is a way in which any revengeful person could inflict
enormous damage on the entire South, at no cost to himself, involve
those states in enormous losses and the expenditure of vast sums of
money, yet go absolutely unpunished!
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Gypsy Moth </span> is a case in point. This winged calamity was imported at Maiden, Massachusetts, near Boston, by a French entomologist, Mr. Leopold Trouvelot, in 1868 or '69. History records the fact that the man of science did not purposely set free the pest. He was endeavoring with live specimens to find a moth that would produce a cocoon of commercial value to America; and a sudden gust of wind blew out of his study, through an open window, his living and breeding specimens of the gypsy moth. The moth itself is not bad to look at, but its larvae is a great, overgrown brute, with an appetite like a hog. Immediately Mr. Trouvelot sought to recover his specimens, and when he failed to find them all. like a man of real honor, he notified the State authorities of the accident. Every effort was made to recover all the specimens, but enough escaped to produce progeny that soon became a scourge to the trees of Massachusetts. The method of the big, nasty-looking mottled-brown caterpillar was very simple. It devoured the entire foliage of every tree that grew in its sphere of influence.
</p>
<p>
The gypsy moth spread with alarming rapidity and persistence. In
course of time the state authorities of Massachuestts were forced to
begin a relentless war upon it, by poisonous sprays and by fire. It
was awful! Up to this date (1912) the New England states and the
United States Government service have expended in fighting this pest
about $7,680,000!
</p>
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page331] </span> </a>
<p>
The spread of this pest has been retarded, but the gypsy moth never
will be wholly stamped out. To-day it exists in Rhode Island,
Connecticut and New Hampshire, and it is due to reach New York at an
early date. It is steadily spreading in three directions from
Boston, its original point of departure, and when it strikes the
State of New York, we, too, will begin to pay dearly for the
Trouvclot experiment. It is said that General S.C. Lawrence, of
Medford, Massachusetts, has spent $75,000 in trying to protect his
trees from the ravages of this scourge.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Rabbit Plague In Australia And New Zealand. </span> &mdash;The rabbit curse upon Australia and New Zealand is so well known as to require little comment. In this case the introduction was deliberate. In the days when the sheep industry was most prosperous, a patriotic gentleman conceived the idea that the introduction of the rabbit, and its establishment as a wild animal, would be a good thing. He reasoned that it would furnish a good food supply, that it would furnish sport, and being unable to harm any other creature of flesh and blood it was therefore harmless. Accordingly, three pairs of rabbits were imported and set free.
</p>
<p>
In a short time, the immense number of rabbits that began to overrun
the country furnished food for reflection, as well as for the table.
A very simple calculation brought out the startling information
that, under perfectly favorable conditions, a single pair of rabbits
could in three years' time produce progeny amounting to 13,718,000
individuals. Ever since that time, in discussing the rabbits of
Australia it has been necessary to speak in millions.
</p>
<p>
"The inhabitants of the colony," says Dr. Richard Lydekker, "soon
found that the rabbits were a plague, for they devoured the grass,
which was needed for the sheep, the bark of trees, and every kind of
fruit and vegetable, until the prospects of the colony became a very
serious matter, and ruin seemed inevitable. In New South Wales
upwards of 15,000,000 rabbits skins have been exported in a single
year; while in thirteen years ending with 1889 no less than
39,000,000 were accounted for in Victoria alone.
</p>
<p>
"To prevent the increase of these rodents, the introduction of
weasels, stoats, mongooses, etc., has been tried; but it has been
found that those carnivores neglected the rabbits and took to
feeding on poultry, and thus became as great a nuisance as the
animals they were intended to destroy. The attempt to kill them off
by the introduction of an epidemic disease has also failed. In order
to protect such portions of the country as are still free from
rabbits, fences of wire netting have been erected; one of these
fences erected by the Government of Victoria extending for a
distance of upwards of one hundred and fifty geographical miles. In
New Zealand, where the rabbit has been introduced little more than
twenty years, its increase has been so enormous, and the destruction
it inflicts so great, that in some districts it has actually been a
question whether the colonists should not vacate the country rather
than attempt to fight against the plague. The average number of
rabbit skins exported from New Zealand is now twelve
millions."&mdash;(Royal Natural History.)

<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page332] </span> </a>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Fox Pest In Australia. </span> &mdash;And now unfortunate Australia has a new pest, also acquired by importation of an alien species. It is the European fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>). The only redeeming feature about this fresh calamity is found in the fact that the species was not deliberately introduced into Australia for the benefit of the local fauna. Mr. O.W. Rosenhain, of Melbourne, informs me (1912) that about thirty years ago the Hunt Club brought to Australia about twenty foxes, for the promotion of the noble sport of fox hunting. In some untoward manner, the most of those animals escaped. They survived, multiplied, and have provided New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with a fox pest of the first rank.
</p>
<p>
The destruction of wild bird life and poultry has become so serious
that Australia now is making vigorous efforts to exterminate the
pest. The government pays ten shillings bounty on fox scalps,
besides which each prime fox skin is worth from four to five
dollars. It is hoped that these combined values will eliminate the
fox pest.
</p>
<p>
Regarding foxes in Australia, Mr. W.H.D. Le Souef has this to say in
his extremely interesting and valuable book, "Wild Life in
Australia," page 146:
</p>
<p>
"We found that foxes were unfortunately plentiful in this district,
and in a hollow log that served to shelter some cubs were noticed
the remains of ducks, fowls, rabbits, lambs, bandicoots and snakes;
so they evidently vary their fare, snakes even not coming amiss.
They also sneak on wild ducks that are nesting by the edge of the
water among the rushes and tussocky grass, and catch quail also,
especially sitting birds. <i> These animals are, and always will be,
a great source of trouble in the thickly timbered country and stony
ranges, and will gradually, like the rabbit, extend all over
Australia</i>. They are evidently not contented with ground game
only, as Mr. A.F. Kelly, of Barwonleigh, in Victoria, states: "When
riding past a bull-oak tree about twenty-five feet high, with either
a magpie's or crow's nest on top. I noticed the nest looked very
bulky, and had something red in it. On going nearer I saw a large
fox coiled up in it!"
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Mongoose. </span> &mdash;Circumstances alter cases, and a change of environment sometimes works marvelous changes in the character of an animal species. Now, <i> why </i> should not the gray Indian mongoose (formerly called the ichneumon, <i> (Herpestes griscus</i>)) destroy poultry in India, as it does elsewhere? There is poultry in plenty to be destroyed, but "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi" elects to specialize on the killing of rats, and cobras, and other snakes.
</p>
<p>
In his own sphere of influence,&mdash;India and the
orient,&mdash;the mongoose is a fairly decent citizen, and he fits
into the time-worn economy of that region. As a destroyer of the
thrice-anathema domestic rat, he has no equal in the domain of flesh
and blood. His temper is so fierce that one "pet" mongoose has been
known to kill a full grown male giant bustard, and put a greyhound
to flight.
</p>
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page333] </span> </a>
<p>
In an evil moment (1872) Mr. W.B. Espeut conceived the idea that it
would be a good thing to introduce mongooses to the rats of
Barbadoes and Jamaica that were pestering the cane-fields to an
annoying extent. It was done. The mongooses attacked the rats,
cleaned them out, multiplied, and then looked about for more worlds
to conquer. Snakes and lizards were few; but they cheerfully killed
and devoured all there were. Then, being continuously hungry, they
attacked the wild birds and poultry, indiscriminately, and with
their usual vigor. I have been told that in Barbadoes "they cleaned
out every living thing that they could catch and kill, and then they
attacked the sugar-cane." The last count in the indictment may seem
hard to believe; but it is a fact that the Indian mongoose often
resorts to fruit and vegetable food.
</p>
<p>
In Jamaica, at the end of the rat-killing period, the planters
joyfully estimated that the labors of Herpestes had saved between
500,000 and 750,000 to the industries of that island. That was
before the slaughter of wild birds and poultry began. I am told that
up to date the damage done by the mongoose far exceeds the value of
the benefit it once conferred, but the total has not been computed.
</p>
<p>
Up to this date, the mongoose has invaded and become a destructive
pest in Barbadoes, Jamaica, Cuba, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Trinidad,
Nevis, Fiji and all the larger islands of the Hawaiian group. It
would require many pages to contain a full account of each
introduction, awakening, reckoning of damages and payment of
bounties for destruction that the fiendish mongoose has wrought out
wherever it has been introduced. The progress of the pest is
everywhere the same,&mdash;sweeping destruction of rats, snakes,
wild birds, small mammals, and finally poultry and vegetables.
</p>
<p>
Every country that now is without the mongoose will do well to shut
and guard diligently all the doors by which it might be introduced.
</p>
<p>
Throughout its range in the western hemisphere, the mongoose is a
pest; and the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has
done well in securing the enactment of a law peremptorily
prohibiting the importation of any animals of that species into the
United States or any of its colonies. The fierce temper, indomitable
courage and vaulting appetite of the mongoose would make its actual
introduction in any of the warm portions of the United States a
horrible calamity. In the southern states, and all along the Pacific
slope clear up to Seattle, it could live, thrive and multiply; and
the slaughter that it could and would inflict upon our wild birds
generally, especially all those that nest and live on the ground,
saying nothing of the slaughter of poultry, would drive the American
people crazy.
</p>
<p>
Fancy an animal with the murderous ferocity of a mink, the agility
of a squirrel, the penetration of a ferret and the cunning of a rat,
infesting the thickets and barnyards of this country. The mongoose
can live wherever a rat can live, provided it can get a fair amount
of animal food. Not for $1,000,000 could any one of the southern or
Pacific states afford to have a pair of these little gray fiends
imported and set free. If such a calamity ever occurs, all wheels
should stop, and <a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page334] </span> </a> every habitant should turn
out and hunt for the animals until they are found and pulverized. No
matter if it should require a thousand men and $100,000, <i> find
them! </i> If not found, the cost to the state will soon be a
million a year, with no ending.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the vigilance of our custom house officers, every now
and then a Hindoo from some foreign vessel sneaks into the country
with a pet mongoose (and they do make great pets!) inside his shirt,
or in the bottom of a bag of clothing. Of course, whenever the
Department of Agriculture discovers any of these surreptitious
animals, they are at once confiscated, and either killed or sent to
a public zoological park for safe-keeping. In New York, the director
of the Zoological Park is so genuinely concerned about the
possibility of the escape of a female mongoose that he has issued
two standing orders: All live mongooses offered to us shall at once
be purchased, and every female animal shall immediately be
chloroformed.
</p>
<p>
If <i> Herpestes griseus </i> ever breaks loose in the United
States, the crime shall not justly be chargeable to us.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The English Sparrow. </span> &mdash;In the United States, the English sparrow is a national sorrow, almost too great to be endured. It is a bird of plain plumage, low tastes, impudent disposition and persistent fertility. Continually does it crowd out its betters, or pugnaciously drive them away, and except on very rare occasions it eats neither insects nor weed seeds. It has no song, and in habits it is a bird of the street and the gutter. There is not one good reason why it should exist in this country. If it were out of the way, our native insect-eaters of song and beauty could return to our lawns and orchards. The English sparrow is a nuisance and a pest, and if it could be returned to the land of its nativity we would gain much.

		NATIONAL AND STATE GAME PRESERVES, AND BIRD REFUGES
	</div>
</div>
<p>
Out West, there is said to be a "feeling" that game and forest
conservation has "gone far enough." In Montana, particularly, the
National Wool-Growers' Association has for some time been firmly
convinced that "the time has come to call a halt." Oh, yes! A halt
on the conservation of game and forests; but not on the free grazing
of sheep on the public domain. No, not even while those same sheep
are busily growing wool that is so fearfully and wonderfully
conserved by a sky-high tariff that the truly poor Americans are
forced to wear garments made of shoddy because they cannot afford to
buy clothing made of wool! (This is the testimony of a responsible
clothing merchant, in 1912.)
</p>
<p>
We can readily understand the new hue and cry against conservation
that the sheep men now are raising. Of course they are against all
new game and forest reserves,&mdash;unless the woolly hordes are
given the right to graze in them!
</p>
<p>
Many men of the Great West,&mdash;the West beyond the Great
Plains,&mdash;are afflicted with a desire to do as they please with
the natural resources of that region. That is the great curse that
to-day rests upon our game. When the nearest game warden is 50 miles
away, and big game is only 5 miles away, it is time for that game to
take to the tall timber.
</p>
<p>
But in the West, and East and South, there are many men and women
who believe in reasonable conservation, and deplore destruction. We
have not by any means reached the point where we can think of
stopping in the making of game preserves, or forest preserves. Of
the former, we have scarcely begun to make. The majority of the
states of our Union know of <i> state </i> game preserves only by
hearsay. But the time is coming when the states will come forward,
and perform the serious duty that they neglect to-day.
</p>
<p>
Let the statesmen of America be not afraid of making too many game
preserves! For the next year, one per day would be none too many!
Remember, that on one hand we have the Army of Destruction, and on
the other the expectant millions of Posterity. No executor or
trustee ever erred in safeguarding an estate too carefully. Fifty
years hence, if your successors and mine find that too much land has
been set aside for the good of the people, they can mighty easily
restore any surplus to the public domain, and at a vastly increased
valuation. Give Posterity at least <i> one </i> chance to debate the
question: "Were our forefathers too liberal in the making of game
and forest reserves?"
</p>
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page336] </span> </a>
<p>
We can always carve up any useless surplus of the public domain, and
restore it to commercial uses; but none of the men of to-day will
live long enough to see so strange a proceeding carried into effect.
</p>
<p>
The game preserves of the United States government are so small
(with the exception of the Yellowstone and Glacier Parks), that very
few people ever hear of them, and fewer still know of them in
detail. It seems to be quite time that they should be set forth
categorically; and it is most earnestly to be hoped that this list
soon will be doubled.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Yellowstone National Park. </span> &mdash;This was the first of the national parks and game preserves of the United States. Some of our game preserves are not exactly national parks, but this is both, by Act of Congress.
</p>
<p>
It is 62 miles long from north to south, 54 miles wide and contains
a total area of 3,348 square miles, or 2,142,720 acres. Its western
border lies in Idaho, and along its northern border a narrow strip
lies in Montana. It is under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of
the Interior, and it is guarded by a detachment of cavalry from the
United States Army. The Superintendent is now a commissioned officer
of the United States Army. The business of protecting the game is
performed partly by four scouts, who are civilians specially engaged
for that purpose, but the number has always been totally inadequate
to the work to be performed.
</p>
<p>
At least one-half of the public interest attaching to the
Yellowstone Park is based upon its wild animals. There, the average
visitor sees, for the first time, wild mountain sheep, antelope,
mule deer, elk, grizzly bears and white pelicans, roaming free. But
for the tragedy of the Park bison herd,&mdash;slaughtered by
poachers from 1890 to 1893, from 300 head down to 30&mdash;visitors
would see wild bison also; but now the few wild bison remaining keep
as far as possible from the routes of tourist travel. The bison were
slaughtered through an inadequate protective force, and (then)
utterly inadequate laws.
</p>
<p>
Lieut.-Col. L.M. Brett, U.S.A., Superintendent of the Yellowstone
Park advises me (July 29, 1912) that the wild big game in the
Yellowstone Park in the summer of 1912, is as shown below, based on
actual counts and estimates of the Park scouts, and particularly
Scout McBride. "The estimates of buffalo, elk, antelope, deer, sheep
and bear are based on actual counts, or very close observations, and
are pretty nearly correct." (Col. Brett).

The actual count of 49 wild bison in the Park, 10 of which are
calves of 1912, will be to all friends of the bison a delightful
surprise. Heretofore the little band had seemed to be stationary,
which if true would soon mean a decline.
</p>
<p>
The history of the wild game of the Yellowstone Park is blackened by
two occurrences, and one existing fact. The fact is: the town of
Gardiner is situated on the northern boundary of the Park, in the
State of Montana. In Gardiner there are a number of men, armed with
rifles, who toward game have the gray-wolf quality of mercy.
</p>
<p>
The first stain is the massacre of the 270 wild bison for their
heads and robes, already noted. The second blot is the equally
savage slaughter in the early winter of 1911, by some of the people
of Gardiner, reinforced by so-called sportsmen from other parts of
the state, of all the park elk they could kill,&mdash;bulls, cows
and calves,&mdash;because a large band wandered across the line into
the shambles of Gardiner, on Buffalo Flats.
</p>
<p>
If the people of Gardiner can not refrain from slaughtering the game
of the Park&mdash;the very animals annually seen by 20,000 visitors
to the Park,&mdash;then it is time for the American people to summon
the town of Gardiner before the bar of public opinion, to show cause
why the town should not be wiped off the map.
</p>
<p>
The 35,000 elk that summer in the Park are compelled in winter to
migrate to lower altitudes in order to find grass that is not under
two feet of snow. In the winter of 1911-12, possibly 5,000 went
south, into Jackson Hole, and 3,000 went northward into Montana. The
sheep-grazing north of the Park, and the general settlement by
ranchmen of Jackson Hole, have deprived the elk herds of those
regions of their natural food. For several years past, up to and
including the winter of 1910-11, some thousands of weak and immature
elk have perished in the Jackson Hole country, from starvation and
exposure. The ranchmen of that region have had terrible
times,&mdash;in witnessing the sufferings of thousands of elk tamed
by hunger, and begging in piteous dumb show for the small and
all-too-few haystacks of the ranchmen.
</p>
<p>
The people of Jackson Hole, headed by S.N. Leek, the famous
photographer and lecturer on those elk herds, have done all that
they could do in the premises. The spirit manifested by them has
been the exact reverse of that manifested in Gardiner. To their
everlasting credit, they have kept domestic sheep out of the Jackson
Valley,&mdash;by giving the owners of invading herds "hours" in
which to get their sheep "all out, and over the western range."

<p>
The prompt manner in which Congress responded in the late winter of
1911 to a distress call in behalf of the starving elk, is beyond all
ordinary terms of praise. It was magnificent. In fear and trembling,
Congress was asked, through Senator Lodge, to appropriate $5,000.
Congress and Senator Lodge made it $20,000; and for the first time
the legislature of Wyoming appealed for national aid to save the
joint-stock herds of Wyoming and the Yellowstone Park.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Glacier Park, Montana. </span> &mdash;In the wild and picturesque mountains of northwestern Montana, covering both sides of the great Continental Divide, there is a region that has been splendidly furnished by the hand of Nature. It is a bewildering maze of thundering peaks, plunging valleys, evergreen forests, glistening glaciers, mirror lakes and roaring mountain streams. Its leading citizens are white mountain goats, mountain sheep, moose, mule deer and white-tailed deer, and among those present are black and grizzly bears galore.
</p>
<p>
Commercially, the 1,400 square miles of Glacier Park, even with its
60 glaciers and 260 lakes, are worth exactly the price of its big
trees, and not a penny more. For mining, agriculture, horticulture
and stock-raising, it is a cipher. As a transcendant pleasure ground
and recreation wilderness for ninety millions of people, it is worth
ninety millions of dollars, and not a penny less. It is a pleasure
park of which the greatest of the nations of the
earth,&mdash;whichever that may be,&mdash;might well be
overbearingly proud; and its accessibility is almost unbelievable
until seen.
</p>
<p>
This park is bounded on the south by the Great Northern Railway, on
the east by the Blackfoot Indian Reservation, on the north by
Alberta and British Columbia, and on the west by West Fork of the
Flathead River. Horizontally, it contains 1,400 square miles; but as
the goat climbs, its area is at least double that. Its valleys are
filled and its lakes are encircled by grand forests of Douglas fir,
hemlock, spruce, white pine, cedar and larch; and if ever they are
destroyed by fire, it will be a national calamity, a century long.
</p>
<p>
<i> So long as the American people keep out of the poorhouse, let
there be no lumber-cutting vandalism in that park, destroying the
beauty of every acre of forest that is touched by axe or saw. The
greatest beauty of those forests is the forest floor, which
lumbering operations would utterly destroy</i>.
</p>
<p>
Never mind if there is "ripe timber" there! The American nation is
not suffering for the dollars that those lovely forest giants would
fetch by board measure. What if a tree does fall now and then from
old age! We can stand the expense. If Posterity a hundred years
hence finds itself lumberless, and wishes to use those trees, then
let Posterity pay the price, and take them. We are not suffering for
them; and our duty is to save them inviolate, and hand them down as
a heritage that we proudly transmit unimpaired.

north, in Alberta, it is soon to be extended by Waterton Lakes Park.
</p>

When I visited Glacier Park, in 1909, with Frederick H. Kennard and
Charles H. Conrad, I procured from three intelligent guides their

As previously stated, one of the surprising features of this new
wonder land is its accessibility. The Great Northern lands you at
Belton. A ride of three miles over a good road through a beautiful
forest brings you to the foot of Lake McDonald, and in one hour more
by boat you are at the hotels at the head of the lake. At that point
you are within three hours' horse-back ride of Sperry Glacier and
the marvelous panorama that unrolls before you from the top of
Lincoln Peak. At the foot of that Peak we saw a big, wild white
mountain goat: and another one watched us climb up to the Sperry
Glacier.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Mt. Olympus National Monument. </span> &mdash;For at least six years the advocates of the preservation of American wild life and forests vainly desired that the grand mountain territory around Mount Olympus, in northwestern Washington, should be established as a national forest and game preserve. In addition to the preservation of the forests, it was greatly desired that the remnant bands of Olympic wapiti (described as <i> Cervus roosevelti</i>) should be perpetuated. It now contains 1,975 specimens of that variety. In Congress, two determined efforts were made in behalf of the region referred to, but both were defeated by the enemies of forests and wild life.
</p>
<p>
In an auspicious moment, Dr. T.S. Palmer, Assistant Chief of the
Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, thought of a law under
which it would be both proper and right to bring the desired
preserve into existence. The law referred to expressly clothes the
President of the United States with power to preserve any monumental
feature of nature which it clearly is the duty of the state to
preserve for all time from the hands of the spoilers.
</p>
<p>
With the enthusiastic approval and assistance of Representative
William E. Humphrey, of Seattle, Dr. Palmer set in motion the
machinery <a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page341] </span> </a> necessary to the carrying of the matter
before the President in proper form, and kept it going, with the
result that on March 2, 1909, President Roosevelt affixed his
signature to the document that closed the circuit.
</p>
<p>
Thus was created the Mount Olympus National Monument, preserving
forever 608,640 acres of magnificent mountains, valleys, glaciers,
streams and forests, and all the wild creatures living therein and
thereon. The people of the state of Washington have good reason to
rejoice in the fact that their most highly-prized scenic wonderland,
and the last survivors of the wapiti in that state, are now
preserved for all coming time. At the same time, we congratulate Dr.
Palmer on the brilliant success of his initiative.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Superior National Game And Forest Preserve. </span> &mdash;The people of Minnesota long desired that a certain great tract of wilderness in the extreme northern portion of that state, now well stocked with moose and deer, should be established as a game and forest preserve. Unfortunately, however, the national government could go no farther than to withdraw the lands (and waters) from entry, and declare it a forest reserve. At the right moment, some bright genius proposed that the national government should by executive order create a "<i>forest </i> reserve," and then that the legislature of Minnesota should pass an act providing that every national forest of that state should also be regarded as a <i> state game preserve</i>!
</p>
<p>
Both those things were done,&mdash;almost as soon as said! Mr.
Carlos Avery, the Executive Agent of the Board of Game and Fish
Commissioners of Minnesota is entitled to great credit for the
action of his state, and we have to thank Mr. Gifford Pinchot and
President Roosevelt for the executive action that represented the
first half of the effort.
</p>
<p>
The new Superior Preserve is valuable as a game and forest reserve,
and nothing else. It is a wilderness of small lakes, marshes,
creeks, hummocks of land, scrubby timber, and practically nothing of
commercial value. But the wilderness contains many moose, and
zoologically, it is for all practical purposes a moose preserve.
</p>
<p>
In it, in 1908 Mr. Avery saw fifty-one moose in three days, Mr.
Fullerton saw 183 in nine days, and Mr. Fullerton estimated the
total number of moose in Minnesota as a whole at 10,000 head.
</p>
<p>
In area it contains 1,420,000 acres, and the creation of this great
preserve was accomplished on April 13, 1909.

	<span class="title"> The Wichita National Game Preserve. </span> &mdash;In the Wichita Mountains, of southwestern Oklahoma, there is a National game preserve containing 57,120 acres. On this preserve is a fenced bison range and a herd of thirty-nine American bison which owe their existence to the initiative of the New York Zoological Society. On March 25, 1905, the Society proposed to the National Government the founding of a range and herd, on a basis that was entirely new. To the Society it seemed desirable that for the encouragement of Congress in the preservation of species that <a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page342] </span> </a> are threatened with extermination, the scientific corporations of America, and private individuals also, should do something more than to offer advice and exhortations to the government.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, the Zoological Society offered to present to the
Government, delivered on the ground in Oklahoma, a herd of fifteen
pure-blood bison as the nucleus of a new national herd, provided
Congress would furnish a satisfactory fenced range, and maintain the
herd. The offer was at once accepted by Hon. James Wilson, Secretary
of Agriculture, and the Society was invited to propose a site for a
range. The Society sent a representative to the Wichita National
Forest Reserve, who recommended a range, and made a report upon it,
which the Society adopted.
</p>
<p>
By act of Congress the range was at once established and fenced. Its
area is twelve square miles (9,760 acres). In October, 1908, the
Zoological Society took from its herd in the Zoological Park nine
female and six male bison, and delivered them at the bison range.
There were many predictions that all those bison would die of Texas
fever within one year; but the parties most interested persisted in
trying conclusions with the famous tick of Texas.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Frank Rush was appointed Warden of the new National Bison Range,
and his management has been so successful that only two of the bison
died of the fever, the disease has been stamped out, and the herd
now contains thirty-nine head. Within five years it should reach the
one-hundred mark. Elk, deer and antelope have been placed in the
range, and all save the antelope are doing well. The Wichita Bison
Range is an unqualified success.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Montana National Bison Range. </span> &mdash;The opening of the Flathead Indian Reservation to settlement, in 1909, afforded a golden opportunity to locate in that region another national bison herd. Accordingly, in 1908, the American Bison Society formulated a plan by which the establishment of such a range and herd might be brought about. That plan was successfully carried into effect, in 1909 and '10.
</p>
<p>
The Bison Society proposed to the national government to donate a
herd of at least twenty-five bison, provided Congress would purchase
a range, fence it and maintain the herd. The offer was immediately
accepted, and with commendable promptness Congress appropriated
$40,000 with which to purchase the range, and fence it. The Bison
Society examined various sites, and finally recommended what was
regarded as an ideal location situated near Ravalli, Montana, north
of the Jocko River and Northern Pacific Railway, and east of the
Flathead River. The nearest stations are Ravalli and Dixon.
</p>
<p>
The area of the range is about twenty-nine square miles (18,521
acres) and for the purpose that it is to serve it is beautiful and
perfect beyond compare. In it the bison herd requires no winter
feeding whatever.
</p>
<p>
In 1910 the Bison Society raised by subscription a fund of $10,526,
and with it purchased 37 very perfect pure-blood bison from the
famous Conrad herd at Kalispell, 22 of which were females. One gift
bison was added by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Goodnight, two were
presented by the <a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page343] </span> </a> estate of Charles Conrad,
and three were presented from the famous Corbin herd, at Newport,
N.H., by the Blue Mountain Forest Association.
</p>
<p>
Starting with that nucleus (of 43 head) in 1910, the herd has
already (1912) increased to 80 head. The herd came through the
severe winter of 1911-1912 without having been fed any hay whatever,
and the founders of it confidently expect to live to see it increase
to one thousand head.

	<span class="title"> The Grand Canyon National Game Preserve </span> of northern Arizona, embraces the entire Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, for a meandering distance of 101 miles, and adjacent territory to an extent of 2,333 square miles (1,492,928 acres). Owing to certain conditions, natural and otherwise, it is not the finest place in the world for the peaceful increase of wild game. The Canyon contains a few mountain sheep, and mule deer, but Buckskin Mountain, on the northwestern side, is reeking with mountain lions and gray wolves, and both those species should be shot out of the entire Grand Canyon National Forest. It was on Buckskin and the western wall of the Canyon itself that "Buffalo" Jones, Mr. Charles S. Bird, and their party caught nine live mountain lions, in 1909.
</p>
<p>
I regret to say that "Buffalo" Jones's catalo experiment on the
Kaibab Plateau seems to have met an untimely and disappointing fate.
For three years the bison and domestic cattle crossed, and produced
a number of cataloes; but in 1911, practically the whole lot was
wiped off the earth by cattle rustlers! Mr. Jones thinks that it was
guerrillas from southern Utah who murdered his enterprise, partly
for the reason that no other persons were within striking distance
of the herd.

	<span class="title"> Mount Rainier National Park. </span> &mdash;This fine forest park is the great summer outing ground of the people of the state of Washington. Its area is 324 square miles, and as its name implies it embraces Mount Rainier. Easily accessible from Seattle and Tacoma, and fairly well&mdash;though not <i> adequately</i>&mdash;provided with roads, trails, tent camps, hotels and livery transportation, it is really the Yellowstone Park of the Northwest.

	<span class="title"> The Yosemite National Park </span> in California is so well known that no description of it is necessary. Its area is 1,124 square miles (719,622 acres). Its great value lies in its scenery, but along with that it is a sanctuary for such of the wild mammals and birds of California as will not wander beyond its borders to the certain death that awaits everything that may legally be killed in that state.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Crater Lake National Park. </span> &mdash;Like all the National Parks of America generally, this one also is a game sanctuary. It is situated on the summit of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. The wonderful Crater Lake itself is 62 miles from Klamath Falls, 83 miles from Ashland, and it is 6 miles long, 4 miles wide and 200 feet deep. This National Park was created by Act of Congress in 1902. Its area is 249 square miles (159,360 acres), and it contains Columbian black-tailed deer, black bear, the silver-gray squirrel, and many birds, chiefly members of the grouse family. Owing to its lofty elevation, there are few ducks.

	<span class="title"> The Sequoia And General Grant National Parks </span> were created for the special purpose of preserving the famous groves of "big trees," <i> (Sequoia gigantea</i>). The former is in Tulare County, the latter in Tulare and Fresno counties, California, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevadas. The area of Sequoia Park is 169,605 acres, and that of General Grant Park is 2,560 acres. They are under the control of the Interior Department. These Parks are important bird refuges, and Mr. Walter Fry, Forest Ranger, reports in them the presence of 261 species of birds, none of which may be hunted or shot. Into Sequoia Park 20 dwarf elk and 84 wild turkeys have been introduced, the former from the herd of Miller and Lux.

	National Monuments
</p>
<p>
Under a special act of Congress, the President of the United States
has the power forever to set aside from private ownership and
occupation any important natural scenery, or curiosity, or
wonderland, the preservation of which may fairly be regarded as of
National importance, and a duty to the whole people of the United
States. This is accomplished by presidential proclamation creating a
"national monument."
</p>
<p>
Under the terms of this act, 28 national monuments have been
created, up to 1912, of which 17 are under the jurisdiction of the
Department of the Interior, and 11 are managed by the Department of
Agriculture. The full list is as follows:

	State Game Preserves In The United States
</p>
<div class="statelist">
	<span class="name"> Pennsylvania: </span>
	<p>
The proposition that every state, territory and province in North
America and everywhere else, should establish a series of state
forest and game preserves, is fairly incontestable. As a business
proposition it is to-day no more a debatable question, or open to
argument, than is the water supply or sewer system of a city. The
only perfect way to conserve a water supply for a great human
population is by acquiring title to water sheds, and either
protecting the forests upon them, or planting forests in case none
exist.
	</p>
	<p>
In one important matter the state of Pennsylvania has been wide
awake, <a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page346] </span> </a> and in advance of the times. I will cite her
system of forest reserves and game preserves as a model plan for
other states to follow; and I sincerely hope that by the time the
members of the present State Game Commission have passed from earth
the people of Pennsylvania will have learned the value of the work
they are now doing, and at least give them the appreciation that is
deserved by public-spirited citizens who do large things for the
People without hope of material reward. At this moment, Commissioner
John M. Phillips and Dr. Joseph Kalbfus are putting their heart's
blood into the business of preserving and increasing the game and
other wild life of Pennsylvania; and the utter lack of appreciation
that is now being shown <i> in some quarters </i> is really
distressing. I refer particularly to the utterly misguided and
mistaken body of hunters and anglers having headquarters at
Harrisburg, whose members are grossly mislead into a wrong position
by a man who seeks to secure a salaried state position through the
hostile organization that he has built up, apparently for his own
use. In the belief that those members generally are mislead and not
mean-spirited, and that the organization contains a majority of
conscientious sportsmen, I predict that ere long the evil genius of
Pennsylvania game protection will be ordered to the rear, while the
organization as a whole takes its place on the side of the Game
Commission, where it belongs.
	</p>
	<p>
The game sanctuary scheme that Pennsylvania has developed is so new
that as yet only a very small fraction of the people of that state
either understand it, or appreciate its far-reaching importance.
	</p>
	<p>
To begin with, Pennsylvania has acquired up to date about one
million acres of forest lands, scattered through 26 of the 67
counties of the state. These great holdings are to be gradually
increased. These wild lands, including many sterile mountain "farms"
of no real value for agricultural purposes, have been acquired,
first of all, for the purpose of conserving the water supply of the
state; and they are called the State Forest Reserves.
	</p>
	<p>
Next in order, the State Game Commission has created, in favorable
localities in the forest reserves, five great game preserves. The
plan is decidedly novel and original, but is very simple withal. In
the center of a great tract of forest reserve, a specially desirable
tract has been chosen, and its boundaries marked out by the
stringing of a single heavy fence wire, surrounding the entire
selection. The area within that boundary wire is an absolute
sanctuary for all wild creatures save those that prey upon game, and
in it no man may hunt anything, nor fire a gun. The boundary wire is
by no means a fence, for it keeps nothing out nor in.
	</p>
	<p>
Outside of the wire and the sanctuary, men may hunt in the open
season, but at the wire every chase must end. If the hunted deer
knows enough to flee to the sanctuary when attacked, so much the
better for the deer. The tide of wild life ebbs and flows under the
wire, and beyond a doubt the deer and grouse will quickly find that
within it lies absolute safety. There the breeding and rearing of
young may go on undisturbed.
	</p>
	<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page347] </span> </a>
	<p>
In view of the fact that hunting may go on in the forest reserve
areas surrounding these sanctuaries, no intelligent sportsman needs
to be told that in a few years all such regions will be teeming with
deer, grouse and other game. Where there is one deer to-day there
will be twenty ten years hence,&mdash;because the law of
Pennsylvania forbids the killing of does; and then there will be
twenty times the legitimate hunting that there is to-day. For
example, the Clinton County Game Preserve of 3,200 acres is
surrounded by 128,000 acres of forest reserve, which form legitimate
hunting grounds for the game bred in the sanctuary reservoir. In
Clearfield County the game sanctuary is surrounded by 47,000 acres
of Forest Reserve.

	<p>
It is the deliberate intention of the Game Commission to increase
these game preserves until there is at least one in each county.
	</p>
	<p>
It is the policy of the Commission to clear out of the game
sanctuaries all the mammals and birds that destroy wild life, such
as foxes, mink, weasels, skunks and destructive hawks and owls. This
is accomplished partly by buying old horses, killing them in the
preserves and poisoning them thoroughly with strychnine.
	</p>
	<p>
Each preserve now contains a nucleus herd of white-tailed deer, some
of them imported from northern Michigan. Ruffed grouse are breeding
rapidly, and in the Clearfield County Preserve there are said to be
at least three thousand. The Game Commission considers it a
patriotic duty to preserve the wild turkey, ruffed grouse and quail,
rather than have those species replaced at great expense by species
imported from the old world. In their work for the protection,
preservation and increase of the game of Pennsylvania&mdash;partly
for the purpose of providing legitimate hunting for the mechanic as
well as the millionaire,&mdash;the State Game Commissioners are
putting a great amount of thought and labor, and whenever their
efforts are criticized, their motives impugned or their honesty
questioned by men who are not worthy to unlace their shoes, it makes
me tired and angry.

	<span class="name"> New York: </span>
	<p class="list">
		<span class="title"> The Adirondack State Park. </span> &mdash;With wise and commendable forethought, the state of New York has preserved in the Adirondack wilderness, familiarly known as "the North Woods," a magnificent forest domain forever dedicated to campers, outdoorsmen and hunters. At present (1912) it contains 2,031 square miles (1,300,000 acres) of forest-clad hills, valleys and mountains, adorned by countless lakes and streams. By some persons it has been believed that in the State's forests the cutting and <a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page348] </span> </a> sale of large trees would be justifiable business, and agreeable to the public; but it has been demonstrated that this is not the case. The people of the state firmly object to the havoc that is <i> unavoidably </i> wrought by logging operations in beautiful forests. The state does not yet need any of the money that could be derived from such operations. The chief anxiety of the public is that hereafter forest fires shall be prevented, no matter what fire protection may cost! The burning of coal on any railway operated through the Adirondacks should be made a penal offense.

	<span class="name"> Montana: </span>
	<p>
In 1911 Governor Norris, Senator Cone and the legislature of
Montana, at the solicitation of W.R. Felton, L.A. Huffman and
others, created the <span class="list"> <span class="title"> Snow
Creek Game Preserve</span></span>, fronting for ten miles on the
Missouri River, in the northern side of Dawson County. It is a
magnificent tract of bad-lands, very deeply eroded and carved, and
highly picturesque. The new state preserve contains 96 square miles,
but there is so little grazing ground for antelope and bison it is
absolutely imperative that a narrow strip of level grass land should
be added along the southern border. This proposed addition is being
fiercely resisted, by an organized movement of the sheep owners of
Montana (the National Wool Growers' Association), who naturally want
the public domain for the free grazing of their tariff-protected
sheep-herds. It remains to be seen whether the <i> three </i> sheep
men south of the preserve,&mdash;the only men who really are
affected,&mdash;will be able to thwart a movement that has for its
object the development of a very good game preserve for the benefit
of the ninety millions of the general American public. The range is
necessary to contain representatives of the big game of the plains
that has been so ruthlessly swept away, and particularly the
vanishing prong-horned antelope, once very numerous in that region.
	</p>
	<p>
In order to relieve the sheep men of all trouble on account of that
preserve, the area should be enlarged to the right dimensions and
made a national preserve. A bill for that purpose (Senate 5,286) is
now before the Senate, in Senator McLean's Committee, and <i> help
is needed </i> to overcome the active hostility of the sheep men,
<i> who vow that it never shall be passed</i>! All persons who read
this are invited to take this matter up with their Senators and
Representatives, without a moment's delay.

		<span class="title"> The Teton State Preserve. </span> &mdash;One of the largest and most important state game preserves thus far established by any of our states is that which was created by Wyoming, in 1904. It is situated along the south of, and fully adjoining, the Yellowstone Park, and its area is 900 square miles (576,000 acres). Its special purpose is to supplement for the elk herds and other big game the protection from killing that previously had been found in the Yellowstone Park alone. The State Preserve is an admirable half-way house for the migrating herds when they leave the National Park to seek their regular winter ranges in and around the Jackson Valley.

Sportsmen's Club.

		GAME PRESERVES AND GAME LAWS IN CANADA
	</div>
</div>
<p>
As now set forth on the map of North America, Canada is a vast
country. We must no longer think of Ontario and Quebec as "Canada
West" and "Canada East," because the new assistant-nation owns and
rules everything from Labrador to British Columbia, and all the
northern mainland save Alaska.
</p>
<p>
Although the fauna of Canada is strictly boreal, it is sufficiently
dispersed and diversified to demand wise legislation, and plenty of
it. For a nation with an outfit of provinces so new, Canada already
is well advanced in the matter of game laws and game preserves, and
in some respects she has set the pace for her southern neighbors.
For example, in New Brunswick we see the lordly moose successfully
hunted for sport, not only without being exterminated but actually
on a basis that permits it to increase in number. In Nova Scotia we
see a law in force <i> which successfully prohibits the waste of
moose meat</i>, a loss that characterizes moose hunting everywhere
else throughout the range of that animal. All over southern Canada
the use of automatic shotguns in hunting is strictly prohibited.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the laws of the Canadians are weak in not
preventing the sale of all wild game and the killing of antelope. In
the matter of game-selling, there are far too many open doors, and a
sweeping reform is very necessary.
</p>
<p>
Speaking generally, and with application from Labrador to British
Columbia, the American process of game extermination according to
law is vigorously and successfully being pursued by the people of
Canada. The open seasons are too long, and the bag limits are too
generous to the gunners. As it is elsewhere, the bag-limit laws on
birds are a farce, because it is impossible to enforce them, save on
every tenth man. For example, in his admirable "Final Report of the
Ontario Game and Fisheries Commission" (1912), Commissioner Kelly
Evans says:
</p>
<p>
"The prairie chicken, which formerly was comparatively plentiful
throughout the greater portion of the Rainy River District, has now
become practically extinct in that region. Various causes have been
assigned for this, but it would seem, as usual, to have been mainly
the fault of indiscriminate and excessive slaughter." (Page 226.)
</p>
<p>
Like the United States, the various portions of Canada have their
various local troubles in wild-life protection. I think the greatest
practical difficulties, and the most real opposition to adequate
measures, is found in the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Is it
because <a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page351] </span> </a> the French-descended population is impatient
of real restraint, and objects to measures that are drastic, even
though they are necessary? In Ontario, Commissioner Evans has been
splendidly supported by the Government, and by all the real
sportsmen of that province; but the gunners and guerrillas of
destruction have successfully postponed several of the reforms that
he has advocated, and which should have been carried into effect.
</p>
<p>
So far as <i> public </i> moral support for game protection is
concerned I think that the prairie and mountain provinces have the
best of it. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Athabasca and
British Columbia, the spirit of the people is mainly correct, and
the chief thing that seems to be lacking is a Kelly Evans in each of
those provinces to urge public sentiment into strong action. For
example, why should Alberta still permit the hunting and killing of
prong-horned antelope, when it is so well known that that species is
vanishing like a mist before the morning sun? I think it is because
no one seems to have risen up as G.O. Shields did in the United
States, to make a big fuss about it, and demand a reform. At any
rate, all the provinces of Canada that still possess antelope should
<i> immediately pass laws giving that species absolute close seasons
for ten years</i>. Why neglect it longer, when such neglect is now
so very wrong? Whether this is done or not, I sincerely hope that
hereafter no true American sportsman, will be guilty of killing one
of the vanishing antelope of Canada, even though "the law doth give
it."
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p class="centerheading">
	The Game Preserves Of Canada
</p>
<p>
In the creation of National parks and game preserves, some of the
provinces of the Canadian nation have displayed a degree of
foresight and enterprise that merits sincere admiration. While in
different provinces the exact status of these establishments may
vary somewhat, the main purpose of each is the same,&mdash;the
preservation of the forests and the wild life. In all of them a
regulated amount of fishing is permitted, and in some the taking of
fur-bearing animals is permitted; but I believe in all the birds and
furless mammals are strictly protected. In some parks the carrying
of firearms still is permitted, but that privilege is quite out of
harmony with the spirit and purposes of a game preserve, and should
be abolished. If it is necessary to carry firearms through a
preserve, as often happens in the Yellowstone Park, it can be done
under seals that are affixed by duly appointed officers and thus
will temptation be kept out of the way of sinners.
</p>
<p>
Up to this date I never have seen a publication which set forth in
one place even so much as an annotated list of the game preserves of
the various provinces of Canada, and at present exact information
regarding them is rather difficult to obtain. It seems that an
adequate governmental publication on this subject is now due, and
overdue.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Ontario. </span> &mdash;"At the present time," says Commissioner Evans in his "Final Report," "the Algonquin National Park is the only actual game preserve <a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page352] </span> </a> in the Province, being in fact a game reserve and not a forest reserve; but in the past at least a measure of protection would seem to have been afforded the game in most of the [forest] reserves, owing to the fact that the carrying of firearms therein has been discouraged, and it would appear to require but the passing of an Order-in-Council to render the carrying of firearms in all reserves illegal. It is sincerely to be hoped that not only will such action be taken without delay, but also that all the forest reserves will be declared game reserves in the strictest sense."
</p>
<p>
To this sentiment all friends of wild life will join a fervent wish
for its realization. As conditions are to-day, it is <i> impossible
to have too many game reserves</i>! There is everything to gain and
nothing to lose by making every national forest and forest reserve
on the whole continent of North America a game preserve in the
strictest sense, and we hope to live to see that end accomplished,
both in the United States and Canada.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="latin"> The Algonquin National Park </span> is situated in the Parry Sound region, just above the Muskoka Lakes, and it has an area of 1,930 square miles. It is well stocked with moose, caribou, white-tailed deer, black bear and beaver. During the period of protection the beaver have increased so greatly that about 1,000 were trapped last year for the market, by officers of the government; and about 25 were sold to zoological gardens and parks, at $25 each.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="latin"> The Quetico Forest Reserve, </span> area 1,560 square miles, was created as the Canadian complement of the Minnesota National Forest and Game Preserve. The two join on the international boundary, and each helps to protect the other. Both are well stocked with moose, and will render valuable service in the preservation of a mid-continental contingent of that species.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Alberta. </span> &mdash;In the making of game preserves the province of Alberta has been splendidly progressive and liberal. The total result is fairly beyond the reach of ordinary words of praise. It sets a pace that should result in wide-spread benefits to the wild life of North America. In it there is nothing faint-hearted. It should make some of our States think seriously regarding their own shortcomings in this particular field of endeavor.

<i> The Rocky Mountains Park </i> is near Banff. The <i> Yoho </i>
and <i> Glacier Parks </i> are near Field. The <i> Buffalo Park </i>
is near Wainwright, on the plains, <a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">
<span class="pagenum"> [Page353] </span> </a> and it was created
and fenced especially as a home for the herd of American bison that
was purchased in Montana in 1909. It now contains 1,052 head of
bison, 20 moose, 35 deer, 7 elk, and 6 antelope.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Elk Island Park </i> is near Fort Saskatchewan and Lamont,
and at this date (1912) it contains 53 bison, 28 elk, 30 deer and 5
moose. The bison subsist entirely by grazing, and upon hay cut
within the Park.
</p>
<p>
<i> Jasper Park</i>, established in 1908, is on the Athabasca River
and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, near Strathcona. Sixty miles of
the railway line lie within the Park. Scenically, Jasper Park is a
rival of Rocky Mountains Park, and undoubtedly possesses great
attractions for travellers who appreciate the beauties and grandeur
of Nature as expressed in mountains, valleys, lakes and streams.
</p>
<p>
<i> Waterton Lakes Park </i> is situated in the extreme southwestern
corner of Alberta, in the Rocky Mountains surrounding the Waterton
Lakes. At present it is nine miles long from north to south and six
miles wide, with its southern end resting on the international
boundary, and adjoining our Glacier Park. It is the home of a few
bands of mountain sheep that carry very large horns. Through the
initiative of Frederick K. Vreeland, the Camp-Fire Club of America
two years ago represented to the Government of Alberta the great
desirability of enlarging this preserve, toward the north and west,
the better to protect the mountain sheep and other big game of that
region. The suggestion was received in a friendly spirit, and there
is good reason to hope that at an early date the enlargement will be
made.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> British Columbia. </span> &mdash;This province has made an excellent beginning in the creation of game preserves. The first agitation on that subject was begun in 1906, by two sportsmen whose names in connection with it have long since been forgotten. On November 15, 1908, the Legislative Council of British Columbia issued a proclamation that created a very fine game preserve in the East Kootenai District, between the Elk and Bull Rivers and northwestward thereof to the White River country. By an unfortunate oversight, the new preserve never has been officially named, but we may designate it here as
</p>
<p>
<i> The Elk River Game Preserve</i>.&mdash;This preserve has a total
area of about 450 square miles, and includes a fine tract of
mountains, valleys, lakes and streams. It contained in 1908 about
1,000 mountain goats, 200 sheep, a few elk and deer, and about 50
grizzly bears. All these have notably increased during the period of
absolute protection that they have enjoyed. It is probable that this
preserve contains more white mountain goats than any other preserve
that thus far has been made. It was in this region that Mr. John M.
Phillips and Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborne made the first mountain
goat photographs ever made at close range. It is to be hoped that
the protection of this preserve, both as to its wild life and its
timber, will be made perpetual.
</p>
<p>
<i> Frazer River Preserve</i>.&mdash;Next after the above there was
created in British Columbia a game preserve covering a large portion
of the mountain territory that rises between the North and South
Forks of the Fraser River. It is about 75 miles long by 30 miles
wide and contains <a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page354] </span> </a> about 2,250 square miles.
Concerning its character and wild-life population we have no
details.
</p>
<p>
<i> Yalakom Game Preserve</i>.&mdash;On the north side of Bridge
River (a western tributary of the Fraser), about twenty miles above
Lilloet, there has been established a game preserve having an area
of about 215 square miles.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Manitoba. </span> &mdash;In the making of game preserves, Manitoba has made an excellent beginning. It is good to see from Duck Mountain in the north to Turtle Mountain in the south a chain of four liberal preserves, each one protected in unmistakable terms as follows: "Carrying firearms, hunting or trapping strictly prohibited within this area."
</p>
<p>
The lake regions of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta form what is
probably the most important wild-fowl breeding-ground in North
America. To a great extent it rests with those provinces to say
whether the central United States shall have any ducks and geese, or
not! <i> It is high time that an international treaty should be made
between the United States, Canada and Mexico for the federal
protection of all migratory birds</i>.
</p>
<p>
These preserves are of course intended to conserve wild-fowl,
shore-birds, grouse and all other birds, as well as big game. Thanks
to the cooperation of Mr. J.M. Macoun, of the Canadian Geological
Survey, I am able to offer the following:

<i> The Laurentides National Park </i> is second in area of all the
national parks of Canada, being surpassed only by the Rocky
Mountains Park of British Columbia. Its area is 3565 square miles,
or 2,281,600 acres. It occupies the entire central portion of the
great area surrounded by Lake St. John, the Saguenay River, the wide
portion of the St. Lawrence, and the St. Maurice River on the west.
Its southern boundary is in several places only 16 miles from the
St. Lawrence, while its most northern angle is within 13 miles of
Lake St. John. Its greatest width from east to west is 71 miles, and
its greatest length from north to south is 79 miles. It covers a
huge watershed in which over a dozen large rivers and many small
ones have their sources. It is indeed a forest primeval. The <a
name="Page_355" id="Page_355"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page355]
</span> </a> rivers are well stocked with fish, and the big game
includes moose, woodland caribou, black bear, lynx, beaver, marten,
fisher, mink, fox, and&mdash;sad to say&mdash;the gray wolf. The
caribou live in rather small bands, from 10 up to 100.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, hunting under license is permitted in the Laurentian
National Park, and therefore it is by no means a <i> real </i> game
preserve! It is a near-preserve.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Gaspesian Forest, Fish and Game Preserve</i>, created in
1906, is in "the Gaspe country," and it has an area of 2500 square
miles situated in the eastern Quebec counties of Gaspe and Matane.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Connaught National Park</i>, to be named in honor of H.R.H.
the Duke of Connaught, has been proposed by Mr. J.M. Macoun, of the
Canadian Geological Survey. The general location chosen is the
mountains and forested territory north of Ottawa and the Ottawa
River, within easy access from the Canadian capitol. On the map the
location recommended lies between the Gatineau River on the east and
Wolf Lake on the west. The proposal is meeting with much popular
favor, and it is extremely probable that it will be carried into
effect at an early date.

<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Labrador. </span> &mdash;During the past two years Lieut.-Col. William Wood has strongly advocated the making of game preserves in Labrador, that will not only tend to preserve the scanty fauna of that region from extinction but will also aid in bringing it back. While Col. Wood's very energetic and praiseworthy campaign has not yet been crowned with success, undoubtedly it will be successful in the near future, because ultimately such causes always win their objects, provided they are prosecuted with the firm and unflagging persistence which has characterized this particular campaign. We congratulate Col. Wood on the success that he <i> will achieve </i> in the near future!

	Game Laws Of The Canadian Provinces
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Alberta. </span> &mdash;The worst feature of the Alberta laws is the annual open season on antelope, two of which may be killed under each license. This is <i> entirely wrong</i>, and a perpetual close season should at once be enacted. Duck shooting in August is wrong, and the season should not open until September. It is not right that duck-killing should be made so easy and so fearfully prolonged that extermination is certain. <i> All killing of cranes and shore birds should be absolutely stopped, for five years</i>. No wheat-producing province can afford the expense to the wheat crops of the slaughter of shore birds, <i> thirty species </i> of which are great crop-protectors.
</p>
<p>
The bag limit of two sheep is too high, by 50 per cent. It should
immediately be cut down to one sheep, before sheep hunting in
Alberta becomes a lost art. <i> Sheep hunting should not be
encouraged</i>&mdash;quite the reverse! There are already too many
sheep-crazy sportsmen. The bag limit on grouse and ptarmigan of 20
per day or 200 in a season is simply legalized slaughter, no more
and no less, and if it is continued, a grouseless province will be
the quick result. The birds are not <a name="Page_356"
id="Page_356"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page356] </span> </a>
sufficiently numerous to withstand the guns on that basis. Alberta
should be wiser than the states below the international boundary
that are annihilating their remnants of birds as fast as they can be
found.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> British Columbia. </span> &mdash;We note with much satisfaction that the Provincial Game Warden, Mr. A. Bryan Williams, has been allowed $37,000 for the pay of game wardens, and $28,000 for the destruction of wolves, coyotes, pumas and other game-destroying animals. During the past two years the following game-destroyers were killed, and bounties were paid upon them:

"Now," says Warden Williams in his excellent annual report for 1911,
"in these two years a total of 2,896 wolves and cougars and 5,141
coyotes were destroyed, as well as a number of others poisoned and
not recovered for the bounty. Allowing fifty head for each wolf and
cougar and ten for each coyote, by their bounties alone 196,210 head
of game and domestic animals were saved. Is it any wonder that deer
are increasing almost everywhere?"
</p>
<p>
The great horned owl has been and still is a great scourge to the
upland game birds, partly because when game is abundant "they become
fastidious, and eat only the brains of their prey." The destruction
of 3,139 of them on the Lower Mainland during the last two years has
made these owls sing very small, and says the warden, "Is it any
wonder that grouse are again increasing?"
</p>
<p>
I have discussed with the Provincial Game Warden the advisability of
putting a limit of one on the grizzly bear, but Mr. Williams
advances good reasons for the opinion that it would be impracticable
to do so at present. I am quite sure, however, that the time has
already arrived when a limit of one is necessary. During the present
year three of my friends who went hunting in British Columbia, <i>
each killed 3 grizzly bears! </i> Hereafter I will "locate" no more
bear hunters in that country until the bag limit is reduced to one
grizzly per year. Since 1905 the trapping of bears south of the main
line of the Canadian Pacific Railway has been stopped; and an
excellent move too. A Rocky Mountain without a grizzly bear is like
a tissue-paper rose.
</p>
<p>
The bag limit on the big game of British Columbia is at least twice
too liberal,&mdash;five deer, two elk, two moose (one in Kootenay
County), three caribou and three goats. There is no necessity for
such wasteful liberality. Few sportsmen go to British Columbia for
the sake of a large lot of animals. I know many men who have been
there to hunt, and the great majority cared more for the scenery and
the wild romance of camping out in ground mountains than for blood
and trophies.
</p>
<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page357] </span> </a>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Manitoba. </span> &mdash;What are we to think of a "bag limit" of fifty ducks per day in October and November? A "limit" indeed! Evidently, Manitoba is tired of having ducks, ruffed grouse, pinnated and other grouse pestering her farmers and laborers. While assuming to fix bag limits that will be of some benefit to those species, the limit is distinctly off, and nothing short of a quick and drastic reform will save a remnant that will remain visible to the naked eye.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> New Brunswick. </span> &mdash;This is the banner province in the protection of moose, caribou and deer, even while permitting them to be shot for sport. Of course, only males are killed, and I am assured by competent judges that thus far the killing of the finest and largest male moose has had no bad effect upon the stature or antlers of the species as a whole.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Nova Scotia. </span> &mdash;If there is anything wrong with the game laws of Nova Scotia, it lies in the wide-open sale of moose meat and all kinds of feathered game during the open season. If that province were more heavily populated, it would mean a great destruction of game. Even with conditions as they are, the sale permitted is entirely wrong, and against the best interests of 97 per cent of the people.
</p>
<p>
As previously mentioned, the law against the waste of moose meat is
both novel and admirable. The saving of any considerable portion of
the flesh of a full-grown bull moose, along with its head, is a
large order; but it is right. The degree of accountability to which
guides are held for the doings of the men whom they pilot into the
woods is entirely commendable, and worthy of imitation. If a
sportsman or gunner does the wrong thing, the guide loses his
license.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Saskatchewan. </span> &mdash;This is another of the too-liberal provinces having no real surplus of big game with which to sustain for any length of time an excess of generosity. I am told that in this province there is now a great deal of open country around each wild animal. And yet, it cheerfully offers two moose, two elk, two caribou and two <i> antelope </i> per season to each licensed gunner or sportsman. The limit is too generous by half. Why throw away an extra $250 worth of game with each license? That is precisely what the people of Saskatchewan are doing to-day.
</p>
<p>
And that antelope-killing! It should be stopped at once, and for ten
years.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Yukon. </span> &mdash;This province permits the sale of all the finest and best wild game within its borders,&mdash;moose, elk, caribou, <i> bison</i>, musk-ox, sheep and goats! The flesh of all these may be sold during the open season, and for sixty days thereafter. Of the species named above, the barren ground caribou is the only one regarding which we need not worry; because that species still exists in millions. The Osborn caribou (<i>Rangiferosborni</i>), can be exterminated in our own times, because it is nowhere really numerous, and it inhabits exposed situations.

		PRIVATE GAME PRESERVES
	</div>
</div>
<p>
Primarily, in the early days of the Man-on-Horseback, the
self-elected and predatory lords of creation evolved the private
game preserve as a scheme for preventing other fellows from
shooting, and for keeping the game sacred to slaughter by
themselves. The idea of conserving the game was a fourth-rate
consideration, the first being the estoppel of the other man. The
old-world owner of a game preserve delights in the annual killing of
the surplus game, and we have even heard it whispered that in the
Dark Ages there were kings who enjoyed the wholesale slaughter of
deer, wild boar, pheasants and grouse. If we may accept as true the
history of sport in Europe, there have been men who have loved
slaughter with a genuine blood-lust that is quite foreign to the
real nature-loving sportsman.
</p>
<p>
In America, the impulse is different. Here, there is raging a
genuine fever for private game preserves. Some of those already
existing are of fine proportions, and cost fortunes to create. Every
true sportsman who is rich enough to own a private game preserve,
sooner or later acquires one. You will find them scattered
throughout the temperate zone of North America from the Bay of Fundy
to San Diego. I have had invitations to visit preserves in an
unbroken chain from the farthest corner of Quebec to the Pacific
Coast, and from Grand Island, Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico.
It was not necessarily to hunt, and kill something, but to <i> see
</i> the game, and the beauties of nature.
</p>
<p>
The wealthy American and Canadian joyously buys a tract of
wilderness, fences it, stocks it with game both great and small, and
provides game keepers for all the year round. At first he has an
idea that he will "hunt" therein, and that his guests will hunt
also, and actually kill game. In a mild way, this fiction sometimes
is maintained for years. The owner may each year shoot two or three
head of his surplus big game, and his tenderfoot guests who don't
know what real hunting is may also kill something, each year. But in
most of the American preserves with which I am well acquainted, the
gentlemanly "sport" of "hunting big game" is almost a joke. The
trouble is, usually, the owner becomes so attached to his big game,
and admires it so sincerely, he has not the heart to kill it
himself; and he finds no joy whatever in seeing it shot down by
others!
</p>
<p>
In this country the slaughter of game for the market is not
considered a gentlemanly pastime, even though there is a surplus of
preserve-bred <a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page359] </span> </a> game that must be reduced.
To the average American, the slaughter of half-tame elk, deer and
birds that have been bred in a preserve does not appeal in the
least. He knows that in the protection of a preserve, the wild
creatures lose much of their fear of man, and become easy marks; and
shall a real sportsman go out with a gun and a bushel of cartridges,
on a pony, and without warning betray the confidence of the wild in
terms of fire and blood? Others may do it if they like; but as a
rule that is not what an American calls "sport." One wide-awake and
well-armed grizzly bear or mountain sheep outwitted on a
mountain-side is worth more as a sporting proposition than a quarter
of a mile of deer carcasses laid out side by side on a nice park
lawn to be photographed as "one day's kill."
</p>
<p>
In America, the shooting of driven game is something of which we
know little save by hearsay. In Europe, it is practiced on
everything from Scotch grouse to Italian ibex. The German Crown
Prince, in his fascinating little volume "From My Hunting Day-Book,"
very neatly fixes the value of such shooting, as a real sportsman's
proposition, in the following sentence:
</p>
<p>
"The shooting of driven game is merely a question of marksmanship,
and is after all more in the nature of a shooting exercise than
sport."
</p>
<p>
I have seen some shooting in preserves that was too tame to be
called sport; but on the other hand I can testify that in grouse
shooting as it is done behind the dogs on Mr. Carnegie's moor at
Skibo, it is sport in which the hunter earns every grouse that falls
to his gun. At the same time, also, I believe that the shooting of
madly running ibex, as it is done by the King of Italy in his three
mountain preserves, is sufficiently difficult to put the best
big-game hunter to the test. There are times when shooting driven
game calls for far more dexterity with the rifle than is ordinarily
demanded in the still-hunt.
</p>
<p>
In America, as in England and on the Continent of Europe, private
game preserves are so numerous it is impossible to mention more than
a very few of them, unless one devotes a volume to the subject.
Probably there are more than five hundred, and no list of them is
"up to date" for more than one day, because the number is constantly
increasing. I make no pretense even of possessing a list of those in
America, and I mention only a few of those with which I am best
acquainted, by way of illustration.
</p>
<p>
One of the earliest and the most celebrated deer parks of the United
States was that of Hon. John Dean Caton, of two hundred acres,
located near Ottawa, Ill., established about 1859. It was the
experiments and observations made in that park that yielded Judge
Caton's justly famous book on "The Antelope and Deer of America."
</p>
<p>
The first game preserve established by an incorporated club was
"Blooming Grove Park," of one thousand acres, in Pennsylvania, where
great success has been attained in the breeding and rearing of
white-tailed deer.
</p>
<p>
In the eastern United States the most widely-known game preserve is
Blue <a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page360] </span> </a> Mountain Forest Park, near Newport, New
Hampshire. It was founded in 1885, by the late Austin Corbin, and
has been loyally and diligently maintained by Austin Corbin, Jr.,
George S. Edgell and the other members of the Corbin family.
Ownership is vested in the Blue Mountain Forest Association. The
area of the preserve is 27,000 acres, and besides embracing much
fine forest on Croydon Mountain, it also contains many converted
farms whose meadow lands afford good grazing.
</p>
<p>
This preserve contains a large herd of bison (86 head), elk,
white-tailed deer, wild boar and much smaller game. The annual
surplus of bison and other large game is regularly sold and
distributed throughout the world for the stocking of other parks and
zoological gardens. Each year a few surplus deer are quietly killed
for the Boston market, but a far greater number are sold alive, at
from $25 to $30 each in carload lots.
</p>
<p>
In the Adirondacks of northern New York, there are a great many
private game preserves. Dr. T.S. Palmer, in his pamphlet on "Private
Game Preserves" (Department of Agriculture) places the number at 60,
and their total area at 791,208 acres. Some of them have caused much
irritation among some of the hunting, fishing and trapping residents
of the Adirondack region. They seem to resent the idea of the
exclusive ownership of lands that are good hunting-grounds. This
view of property rights has caused much trouble and some bloodshed,
two persons having been killed for presuming to assert exclusive
rights in large tracts of wilderness property.
</p>
<p>
"In the upland preserve under private ownership." says Dr. Palmer,
"may be found one of the most important factors in the maintenance
of the future supply of game and game birds. Nearly all such
preserves are maintained for the propagation of deer, quail, grouse,
or pheasants. They vary widely in area, character, and purpose, and
embrace some of the largest game refuges in the country. Some of the
preserves in North Carolina cover from 15,000 to 30,000 acres;
several in South Carolina exceed 60,000 acres in extent." The
Megantic Club's northern preserve, on the boundary between Quebec
and Maine, embraces nearly 200 square miles, or upward of 125,000
acres.
</p>
<p>
Comparatively few of the larger preserves are enclosed, and on such
grounds, hunting becomes sport quite as genuine as it is in regions
open to free hunting. In some instances part of the tract is fenced,
while large unenclosed areas are protected by being posted. The
character of their tenure varies also. Some are owned in fee simple;
others, particularly the larger ones, are leased, or else comprise
merely the shooting rights on the land. In both size and tenure, the
upland preserves of the United States are comparable with the grouse
moors and large deer forests of Scotland.
</p>
<p>
Of the game preserves in the South, I know one that is quite ideal.
It is St. Vincent Island, near Apalachicola, Florida, in the
northern edge of the Gulf of Mexico. It was purchased in 1909 by Dr.
Ray V. Pierce, and his guests kill perhaps one hundred ducks each
year out of the thousands that flock to the ten big ponds that
occupy the eastern third of the island. Into those ponds much good
duck food has been <a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page361] </span> </a>
introduced,&mdash;<i>Potamogeton pectinatus </i> and <i>
perfoliatus</i>. The area of the island is twenty square miles.
Besides being a great winter resort for ducks, its sandy,
pine-covered ridges and jungles of palms to and live oak afford fine
haunts and feeding grounds for deer. Those jungles contain two
species of white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus louisiana </i> and <i>
osceola</i>), and Dr. Pierce has introduced the Indian sambar deer
and Japanese sika deer <i> (Cervus sika</i>), both of which are
doing well. We are watching the progress of those big sambar deer
with very keen interest, and it is to be recorded that already that
species has crossed with the Louisiana white-tailed deer.

<p class="captionheading">
	MAP OF MARSH ISLAND AND ADJACENT WILD-FOWL PRESERVES
</p>
<p>
During the autumn of 1912, public attention in the United States was
for a time focused on the purchase of Marsh Island, Louisiana, by
Mrs. Russell Sage, and its permanent dedication to the cause of
wild-life protection. This delightful event has brought into notice
the Louisiana State Game Preserve of 13,000 acres near Marsh Island,
and its hinterland (and water) of 11,000 acres adjoining, which
constitutes the Ward-McIlhenny Wild Fowl Preserve. These three great
preserves taken together as they lie form a wild-fowl sanctuary of
great size, and of great value to the whole Mississippi Valley. Now
that all duck-shooting therein has been stopped, it is safe to
predict that they shortly will be inhabited by a wild-fowl
population that will really stagger the imagination.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Duck-Shooting "Preserves." </span> &mdash;A ducking "preserve" is a large tract of land and water owned by a few individuals, or a club, for the purpose of preserving exclusively for themselves and their friends the best <a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page362] </span> </a> possible opportunities for killing large numbers of ducks and geese without interference. In no sense whatever are they intended to preserve or increase the supply of wild fowl. The real object of their existence is duck and goose slaughter. For example, the worst goose-slaughter story on record comes to us from the grounds of the Glenn County Club in California, whereon, as stated elsewhere, two men armed with automatic shotguns killed 218 geese in one hour, and bagged a total of 452 in one day.
</p>
<p>
I shall not attempt to give any list of the so-called ducking
"preserves." The word "preserve," when applied to them, is a
misnomer. Thirteen states have these incorporated
slaughtering-grounds for ducks and geese, the greatest number being
in California, Illinois, North Carolina and Virginia. California has
carried the ducking-club idea to the limit where it is claimed that
it constitutes an abuse. Dr. Palmer says that one or two of the club
preserves on the western side of the San Joaquin Valley contain
upward of <i> 40 square miles, or 25,000 acres each</i>! With
considerable asperity it is now publicly charged (in the columns of
<i> The Examiner </i> of San Francisco) that for the unattached
sportsmen there is no longer any duck-shooting to be had in
California, because all the good ducking-grounds are owned and
exclusively controlled by clubs. In many states the private game
preserves are a source of great irritation, and many have been
attacked in courts of law. <a name="FNanchorN" id="FNanchorN"> </a>
<a class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_N"> [N] </a>
</p>
<p>
But I am not sorrowing over the woes of the unattached duck-hunter,
or in the least inclined to champion his cause against the
ducking-club member. As slaughterers and exterminators of wild-fowl,
rarely exercising mercy under ridiculous bag-limits, they have both
been too heedless of the future, and one is just as bad for the game
as the other. If either of them favored the game, I would be on his
side; but I see no difference between them. They both kill right up
to the bag-limit, as often as they can; and that is what is sweeping
away all our feathered game.
</p>
<p>
Curiously enough, the angry unattached duck-hunters of California
are to-day proposing to have revenge on the duck-clubbers by <i>
removing all restrictions on the sale of game</i>! This is on the
theory that the duckless sportsmen of the State of California would
like to <i> buy </i> dead ducks and geese for their tables! It is a
novel and original theory, but the sane people of California never
will enact it into law. It would be a step just <i> twenty years
backward</i>!
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Public vs. The Private Game Preserve. </span> &mdash;Both the executive and the judiciary branches of our state governments will in the future be called upon with increasing frequency to sit in judgment on this case. Conditions about us are rapidly changing. The precepts of yesterday may be out of date and worthless tomorrow. By way of introspection, let us see what principles of equity toward Man and Nature we would lay down as the basis of our action if we were called to the bench. Named in logical sequence they would be about as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Any private game "preserve" that is maintained chiefly as a <a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page363] </span> </a> slaughter-ground for wild game, either birds or mammals, may become detrimental to the interests of the people at large.
	</li>
	<li>
		It is not necessarily the duty of any state to provide for the maintenance of private death-traps for the wholesale slaughter of <i> migratory </i> game.
	</li>
	<li>
		An oppressive monopoly in the slaughter of migratory game is detrimental to the interests of the public at large, the same as any other monopoly.
	</li>
	<li>
		Every de facto game preserve, maintained for the preservation of wild life rather than for its slaughter, is an institution beneficial to the public at large, and therefore entitled to legal rights and privileges above and beyond all which may rightly be accorded to the so-called "preserves" that are maintained as killing-grounds.
	</li>
	<li>
		The law may justly discriminate between the actual game preserve and the mere killing-ground.
	</li>
	<li>
		Whenever a killing-ground becomes a public burden, it may be abated, the same as any other public infliction.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
In private game preserves the time has arrived when lawmakers and
judges must begin to apply the blood-test, and separate the true
from the false. And at every step, <i> the welfare of the wild life
involved </i> must be given full consideration. No men, nor body of
men, should be permitted to practice methods that spell
extermination.

	<div class="subtitle">
		BRITISH GAME PRESERVES IN AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA
	</div>
</div>
<p>
This brief chapter is offered as an object-lesson to the world at
large.
</p>
<p>
In the early days of America, the founders of our states and
territories gave little heed, or none at all, to the preservation of
wild life. Even if they thought of that duty, undoubtedly they felt
that the game would always last, and that they had no time for such
sentimental side issues as the making of game preserves. They were
coping with troubles and perplexities of many kinds, and it is not
to be wondered at that up to forty years ago, real game protection
in America went chiefly by default.
</p>
<p>
In South Africa, precisely the same conditions have prevailed until
recent times. The early colonists were kept so busy shooting lions
and making farms that not one game preserve was made. If any men can
be excused from the work and worry of preserving game, and making
preserves, it is those who spend their lives pioneering and
state-building in countries like Africa. Men who continually have to
contend with disease, bad food, rains, insect pests, dangerous wild
beasts and native cussedness may well claim that they have troubles
enough, without going far into campaigns to preserve wild animals in
countries where animals are plentiful and cheap. It is for this
reason that the people of Alaska can not be relied upon to preserve
the Alaskan game. They are busy with other things that are of more
importance to them.
</p>
<p>
In May, 1900, representatives of the great powers owning territory
in Africa held a conference in the interests of the wild-animal life
of that continent. As a result a Convention was signed by which
those powers bound themselves "to make provision for the prevention
of further undue destruction of wild game." The principles laid down
for universal observance were as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Sparing of females and immature animals.
	</li>
	<li>
		The establishment of close seasons and game sanctuaries.
	</li>
	<li>
		Absolute protection of rare species.
	</li>
	<li>
		Restrictions on export for trading purposes of skins, horns, tusks, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Prohibition of the use of pits, snares and game traps.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
The brave and hardy men who are making for the British people a
grand empire in Africa probably are greater men than far-distant
people realize. To them, the white man's burden of game preservation
is accepted as all in the day's work. A mere handful of British
civil officers, strongly aided by the Society for the Preservation
of the Fauna of the British Empire, have carved out and set aside a
great chain of game preserves reaching all the way from Swaziland
and the Transvaal to Khartoum. Taken either collectively or
separately, it represents <a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page365] </span> </a> grand work, characteristic
of the greatest colonizers on earth. Those preserves are worthy
stones in the foundation of what one day will be a great British
empire in Africa. The names of the men who proposed them and wrought
them out should, in some way, be imperishably connected with them as
their founders, as the least reward that Posterity can bestow.
</p>
<p>
In Major J. Stevenson-Hamilton's fine work, "Animal Life in Africa,"
<a name="FNanchorO" id="FNanchorO"> </a> <a class="footnote-marker"
href="#Footnote_O"> [O] </a> the author has been at much pains to
publish an excellent series of maps showing the locations of the
various British game preserves in Africa, and the map published
herewith has been based chiefly on that work. It is indeed fortunate
for the wild life of Africa that it has today so powerful a champion
and exponent as this author, the warden of the Transvaal Game
Preserves.
</p>
<p>
Events move so rapidly that up to this date no one, so far as I am
aware, has paused long enough to make and publish an annotated list
of the African game preserves. Herein I have attempted to <i> begin
</i> that task myself, and I regret that at this distance it is
impossible for me to set down under the several titles the names of
the men who made these preserves possible, and actually founded
them.
</p>
<p>
To thoughtful Americans I particularly commend this list as a
showing of the work of men who have not waited until the game had
been <i> practically exterminated </i> before creating sanctuaries
in which to preserve it. In view of these results, how trivial and
small of soul seems the mercenary efforts of the organized
wool-growers of Montana to thwart our plan to secure a paltry
fifteen square miles of grass lands for the rugged and arid Snow
Creek Antelope Preserve that is intended to help save a valuable
species from quick extermination.
</p>
<p>
At this point I must quote the views of a high authority on the
status of wild life and game preserves in Africa. The following is
from Major Stevenson-Hamilton's book.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
"It is a remarkable phenomenon in human affairs how seldom the
experience of others seems to turn the scale of action. There are, I
take it, very few farmers, in the Cape Colony, the Orange Free
State, or the Transvaal, who would not be glad to see an adequate
supply of game upon their land. Indeed, the writer is constantly
dealing with applications as to the possibility of reintroducing
various species from the game reserves to private farms, and only
the question of expense and the difficulty of transport have, up to
the present, prevented this being done on a considerable scale.
When, therefore, the relatively small populations of such
protectorates as are still well stocked with game are heard airily
discussing the advisability of getting rid of it as quickly as
possible, one realizes how often vain are the teachings of history,
and how well-nigh hopeless it is to quote the result of similar
action elsewhere. It remains only to trust that things may be seen
in truer perspective ere it is too late, and that those in whose
temporary charge it is may not cast recklessly away one of nature's
most splendid assets, one, moreover, which once lightly discarded,
can never by any possibility, be regained.

"It is idle to say that the advance of civilization must necessarily
mean the total disappearance of all wild animals. This is one of
those glib fallacies which flows only too readily from unthinking
lips. Civilization in its full sense&mdash;not the advent of a few
scattered pioneers&mdash;of course, implies their restriction,
especially as regards purely grass-feeding species, within certain
definite bounds, both as regards numbers and sanctuaries. But this
is a very different thing from wholesale destruction, that a few
more or less deserving individuals may receive some small pecuniary
benefit, or gratify their taste for slaughter to the detriment of
everyone else who may come after. <i> The fauna of an empire is the
property of that empire as a whole, and not of the small portion of
it where the animals may happen to exist; and while full justice and
encouragement must be given to the farmer and pioneer, neither
should be permitted to entirely demolish for his own advantage
resources which, strictly speaking, are not his
own</i>."&mdash;("Animal Life in Africa." p. 24.)

<div class="statelist">
	<span class="name"> British East Africa: </span>
	<p>
1. <a name="FNanchorP" id="FNanchorP"> </a> <a
class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_P"> [P] </a> <i> The Athi
Plains Preserve</i>.&mdash;This is situated between the Uganda
Railway and the boundary of German East Africa. Its northern
boundary is one mile north of the railway track. It is about 215
miles long east and west by 105 miles from north to south, and its
area is about 13,000 square miles. It is truly a great preserve, and
worthy of the plains fauna that it is specially intended to
perpetuate.
	</p>
	<p>
2. <i> The Jubaland Preserve</i>.&mdash;This preserve lies northwest
of Mount Kenia. Its southwestern corner is near Lake Baringo, the
Laikipia Escarpment is its western boundary up to Mt. Nyiro, and
from that point its northern boundary runs 225 miles to Marsabit
Lake. From that point the boundary runs south-by-west to the Guaso
Nyiro River, which forms the eastern half of the southern boundary.
Its total area appears to be about 13,000 square miles.
	</p>
	<p>
In addition to the two great preserves described above the
government of British East Africa has established on the Uasin Gishu
Plateau a centrally located sanctuary for elands, roan antelopes and
hippopotamii. There is also a small special rhinoceros preserve
about fifty miles southeastward of Nairobi, around Kiu station, on
the railway.
	</p>
	<span class="name"> Egyptian Sudan: </span>
	<p>
3. A great nameless sanctuary for wild life exists on the eastern
bank of the Nile, comprising the whole territory between the main
stream, the Blue Nile and Abyssinia. Its length (north and south) is
215 miles, and its width is about 125 miles; which means a total
area of about 26,875 square miles. Natives and others living within
this sanctuary may hunt therein&mdash;if they can procure licenses.

extreme southern end of the Protectorate, on both sides of the Shire
River, chiefly for buffalo.
	</p>
	<p>
9. <i> Angoniland Reserve</i>.&mdash;This was created especially to
preserve about one thousand elephants. It is forty miles west of the
southwestern arm of Lake Nyasa.

<i> Kangaroo Island</i>, near Adelaide, South Australia, is 400
miles northwest of Melbourne. Of the total area of this rather large
island of 300 square miles, 140 square miles have been set aside as
a game preserve, chiefly for the preservation of the mallee bird
(<i>Lipoa occelata</i>). It is believed that eventually the whole
island will become a wild-life sanctuary, and it would seem that
this can not be consummated a day too soon for the vanishing wild
life.
	</p>
	<p>
<i> Wilson's Promontory</i>. Adelaide, is a peninsula well suited to
the preservation of wild life, especially birds, and it is now a
sanctuary.
	</p>
	<p>
Many private bird refuges have been created in Australia.

soon will be provided by the government. I am informed that this
offers a golden opportunity to secure a fine wild-life sanctuary at
ridiculously small cost to the public. The whole world is interested
in the preservation of the remarkable fauna of Tasmania. The
extermination of the thylacine would be a zoological calamity; but
it is impending.

	<div class="subtitle">
		BREEDING GAME AND FUR IN CAPTIVITY
	</div>
</div>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Game Breeding. </span> &mdash;The breeding of game in captivity for sale in the markets of the world is just as legitimate as the breeding of domestic species. This applies equally to mammals, birds, reptiles and fishes. It is the duty of the nation and the state to foster such industries and facilitate the marketing of their products without any unnecessary formalities, delays or losses to producers or to purchasers.
</p>
<p>
Already this principle has been established in several states.
Without going into the records, it is safe to say that Colorado was
the pioneer in the so-called "more-game" movement, about 1899; but
there is one person who would like to have the world believe that it
started in the state of New York, about 1909. The idea is not quite
as "old as the hills," but the application of it in the United
States dates back through a considerable vista of years.
</p>
<p>
The laws of Colorado providing for the creation of private game
preserves and the marketing of their product under a tagging system,
are very elaborate, and they show a sincere desire to foster an
industry as yet but slightly developed in this country. The laws of
New York are much more simple and easy to understand than those of
Colorado.
</p>
<p>
There is one important principle now fully recognized in the New
York laws for game breeding that other states will do well to adopt.
It is the fact that certain kinds of wild game <i> can not be bred
and reared in captivity on a commercial basis</i>; and this being
true, it is clearly against public policy to provide for the sale of
any such species. Why provide for the sale of preserve-bred grouse
and ducks which we know can not be bred and reared in confinement in
marketable numbers? For example, if we may judge by the numerous
experiments that <i> thus far </i> have been made,&mdash;as we
certainly have a right to do,&mdash;no man can successfully breed
and rear in captivity, on a commercial basis, the canvasback duck,
teal, pintail duck, ruffed grouse or quail. This being the case, no
amount of clamor from game dealers and their allies ever should
induce any state legislature to provide for the sale of any of those
species <i> until it has been fully demonstrated </i> that they <i>
have been </i> and <i> can be </i> bred in captivity in large
numbers. The moment the markets of a state are thrown open to these
impossible species, from that moment the state game wardens must
make a continuous struggle to prevent the importation and sale of
those birds contrary to law. This proposition is so simple that
every honest man can see it.
</p>
<p>
All that any state legislature may rightfully be asked to do is to
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page370]
</span> </a> provide for the sale, under tags, of those species
which <i> we know </i> can be bred in captivity in large numbers.
</p>
<p>
When the Bayne law was drafted, its authors considered with the
utmost care the possibilities in the breeding of game in the United
States on a commercial basis. It was found that as yet only two wild
native species have been, and can be, reared in captivity on a large
scale. These are the white-tailed deer and mallard duck. Of foreign
species we can breed successfully for market the fallow deer, red
deer of Europe and some of the pheasants of the old world. For the
rearing, killing and marketing of all these, the Bayne law provides
the simplest processes of state supervision that the best game
protectors and game breeders of New York could devise. The tagging
system is expeditious, cheap and effective. Practically the only
real concession that is required of the game-breeder concerns the
killing, which must be done in a systematic way, whereby a state
game warden can visit the breeder's premises and affix the tags
without any serious sacrifice of time or convenience on either side.
The tags cost the breeder five cents each, and they pay the cost of
the services rendered by the state.
</p>
<p>
By this admirable system, which is very plainly set forth in the New
York Conservation Commission's book of game laws, all the <i> wild
</i> game of New York, <i> and of every other state</i>, is
absolutely protected at all times against illegal killing and
illegal importation for the New York market. Now, is it not the duty
of Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and every other
state to return our compliment by passing similar laws?
Massachusetts came up to public expectations at the next session of
her legislature after the passage of our Bayne law. In 1913,
California will try to secure a similar act; and we know full well
that her ducks, geese, quail, grouse and band-tailed pigeon need it
very much. If the California protectors of wild life succeed in
arousing the great quiet mass of people in that state, their Bayne
bill will be swept through their legislature on a tidal wave of
popular sentiment.
</p>
<p>
<i> Elk</i>.&mdash;For people who own wild woodlands near large
cities there are good profits to be made in rearing white-tailed
deer for the market. I would also mention elk, but for the fact that
every man who rears a fine herd of elk quickly becomes so proud of
the animals, and so much attached to them, that he can not bear to
have them shot and butchered for market! Elk are just as easy to
breed and rear as domestic cattle, except that in the fall breeding
season, the fighting of rival bulls demands careful and intelligent
management. Concerning the possibilities of feeding elk on hay at
$25 per ton and declaring an annual profit, I am not informed. If
the elk require to be fed all the year round, the high price of hay
and grain might easily render it impossible to produce marketable
three-year-old animals at a profit.
</p>
<p>
<i> White-tailed Deer</i>.&mdash;Any one who owns from one hundred
to one thousand acres of wild, brushy or forest-covered land can
raise white-tailed (or Virginia) deer at a profit. With smaller
areas of land, free range <a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page371] </span> </a> becomes impossible, and the
prospects of commercial profits diminish and disappear. In any
event, a fenced range is absolutely essential; and the best fence is
the Page, 88 inches high, all horizontals of No. 9 wire, top and
bottom wires of No. 7, and the perpendicular tie-wires of No. 12.
This fence will hold deer, elk, bison and wild horses. In large
enclosures, the white-tailed deer is hardy and prolific, and when
fairly cooked its flesh is a great delicacy. In Vermont the average
weights of the deer killed in that state in various years have been
as follow:&mdash;in 1902, 171 lbs.; in 1903, 190 lbs.; in 1905, 198
lbs.; in 1906, 200 lbs.; in 1907, 196 lbs.; in 1908, 207 lbs.; and
in 1909, 155 lbs. The reason for the great drop in 1909 is yet to be
ascertained.
</p>
<p>
In 1910, in New York City the wholesale price of whole deer
carcasses was from 22 to 25 cents per pound. Venison saddles were
worth from 30 to 35 cents per pound. On the bill of fare of a first
class hotel, a portion of venison costs from $1.50 to $2.50
according to the diner's location. It is probable that such prices
as these will prevail only in the largest cities, and therefore they
must not be regarded as general.
</p>
<p>
Live white-tailed deer can be purchased for breeding purposes at
prices ranging from $25 to $35 each. A good eastern source of supply
is Blue Mountain Forest, Mr. Austin Corbin, president (Broadway and
Cortlandt St., New York). In the West, good stock can be procured
from the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, through C.V.R. Townsend,
Negaunee, Mich., whose preserve occupies the whole of Grand Island,
Lake Superior.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Agriculture has published for free distribution a
pamphlet entitled "Raising Deer and Other Large Game Animals" in the
United States, by David E. Lantz, which contains much valuable
information, although it leaves much unsaid.
</p>
<p>
All breeders of deer are cautioned that during the fall and early
winter months, all adult white-tailed bucks are dangerous to man,
and should be treated accordingly. A measure of safety can be
secured in a large park by compelling the deer always to keep at a
respectful distance, and making no "pets," whatever. Whenever a buck
finds his horns and loses his fear of man, climb the fence quickly.
Bucks in the rutting season sometimes seem to go crazy, and often
they attack men, wantonly and dangerously. The method of attack is
to an unarmed man almost irresistible. The animal lowers his head,
stiffens his neck and with terrible force drives straight forward
for your stomach and bowels. Usually there are eight sharp spears of
bone to impale you. The best defense of an unarmed man is to seize
the left antler with the left hand, and with the right hand pull the
deer's right front foot from under him. Merely holding to the horns
makes great sport for the deer. He loves that unequal combat. The
great desideratum is to put his fore legs out of commission, and get
him down on his knees.
</p>
<p>
Does are sometimes dangerous, and inflict serious damage by rising
on their hind feet and viciously striking with their sharp front
hoofs. These tendencies in American deer are mentioned here as a
duty to persons who may desire to breed deer for profit.
</p>
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page372] </span> </a>
<p>
<i> The Red Deer of Europe</i>.&mdash;Anyone who has plenty of
natural forest food for deer and a good market within fair range,
may find the European red deer a desirable species. It is of size
smaller, and more easily managed, than the wapiti; and is more
easily marketed because of its smaller size. As a species it is
hardy and prolific, and of course its venison is as good as that of
any other deer. Live specimens for stocking purposes can be
purchased of S.A. Stephan, Agent for Carl Hagenbeck, Cincinnati
Zoological Gardens, or of Wenz &amp; Mackensen, Yardley, Pa., at
prices ranging from $60 to $100 each, according to size and age. At
present the supply of specimens in this country on hand for sale is
very small.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Fallow Deer</i>.&mdash;This species is the most universal
park deer of Europe. It seems to be invulnerable to neglect and
misuse, for it has persisted through countless generations of
breeding in captivity, and the abuse of all nations. In size it is a
trifle smaller than our white-tailed deer, with spots in summer, and
horns that are widely flattened at the extremities in a very
interesting way. It is very hardy and prolific, but of course it can
not stand everything that could be put upon it. It needs a dry shed
in winter, red clover hay and crushed oats for winter food; and no
deer should be kept in mud. As a commercial proposition it is not so
meaty as the white-tail, but it is <i> less troublesome to keep</i>.
The adult males are not such vicious or dangerous fighters as
white-tail bucks. Live specimens are worth from $50 to $75. The
Essex County Park Commissioners (Orange, New Jersey) have had
excellent success with this species. In 1906 they purchased
twenty-five does and four bucks and placed them in an enclosure of
150 acres, on a wooded mountain-side. In 1912 they had 150 deer, and
were obliged to take measures for a disposal of the surplus. Messrs.
Wenz &amp; Mackensen, keep an almost continuous supply of fallow
deer on hand for sale.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Indian Sambar Deer</i>.&mdash;I have long advocated the
introduction in the southern states, <i> wherever deer can be
protected</i>, of this great, hulking, animated venison-factory.
While I have not delved deeply into the subject of weight and
growth, I feel sure from casual observations of the growth of about
twenty-five animals that this species produces more venison during
the first two years of its life than any other deer with which I am
acquainted. I regard it as the greatest venison-producer of the
whole Deer Family; and I know that is a large order. The size of a
yearling is almost absurd, it is so great for an animal of tender
years. When adult, the species is for its height very large and
heavy. As a food-producing animal, located in the southern hill
forests and taking care of itself, "there's millions in it!" But <i>
it must be kept under fence</i>; for in no southern (or northern)
state would any such mass of juicy wild meat long be permitted to
roam at large unkilled. Through this species I believe that a
million acres of southern timber lands, now useless except for
timber growth, could be made very productive in choice venison. The
price would be,&mdash;a good fence, and protection from poachers.
</p>
<p>
The Indian sambar deer looks like a short-legged big-bodied
understudy of our American elk. It breeds well in captivity, and it
is of quiet <a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page373] </span> </a> and tractable disposition. It can not live
in a country where the temperature goes down to 25 F. and <i>
remains there for long periods</i>. It would, I am firmly convinced,
do well all along the Gulf coast, and if acclimatized along the
Gulf, with the lapse of time and generations it would become more
and more hardy, grow more hair, and push its way northward, until it
reached the latitude of Tennessee. But then, in a wild state it
could not be protected from poachers. As stated elsewhere, Dr. Ray
V. Pierce has successfully acclimatized and bred this species in his
St. Vincent Island game preserve, near Apalachicola, Florida. More
than that, the species has crossed with the white-tailed deer of the
Island.
</p>
<p>
Living specimen of the Indian Sambar deer are worth from $125 to
$250, according to size and other conditions. Just at present it
seems difficult for Americans to procure a sufficient number of <i>
males! </i> We have had very bad luck with several males that we
attempted to import for breeding purposes.
</p>
<p>
<i> The Mallard Duck</i>.&mdash;A great many persons have made
persistent attempts to breed the canvasback, redhead, mallard, black
duck, pintail, teal and other species, on a commercial basis. So far
as I am aware the mallard is the only wild duck that has been bred
in sufficient numbers to slaughter for the markets. The wood duck
and mandarin can be bred in fair numbers, but only sufficient to
supply the demand for <i> living </i> birds, for park purposes. One
would naturally suppose that a species as closely allied to the
mallard as the black duck <i> is </i> known to be, would breed like
the mallard; but the black duck is so timid and nervous about
nesting as to be almost worthless in captivity. All the species
named above, except the mallard, must at present, and in general, be
regarded as failures in breeding for the market.
</p>
<p>
Of all American ducks the common mallard is the most persistent and
successful breeder. It quickly becomes accustomed to captivity, it
enjoys park life, and when given even half a chance it will breed
and rear its young.
</p>
<p>
Unquestionably, the mallard duck can be reared in captivity in
numbers limited only by the extent of breeder's facilities. The
amount of net profit that can be realized depends wholly upon the
business acumen and judgment displayed in the management of the
flock. The total amount of knowledge necessary to success is not so
very great, but at the same time, the exercise of a fair amount of
intelligence, and also careful diligence, is absolutely necessary.
Naturally the care and food of the flock must not cost
extravagantly, or the profits will inevitably disappear.
</p>
<p>
As a contribution to the cause of game-breeding for the market, and
the creation of a new industry of value, Mr. L.S. Crandall and the
author wrote for the New York State Conservation Commission a
pamphlet on "Breeding Mallard Ducks for Market." Copies of it can be
procured of our State Conservation Commission at Albany, by
enclosing ten cents in stamps.

	Breeding Fur-Bearing Animals
</p>
<p>
When hundreds of persons wrote to me asking for literature on the
breeding of fur-bearing animals for profit, for ten years I was
compelled to tell them that there was no such literature. During the
past three years a few offerings have been made, and I lose not a
moment in listing them here.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Life Histories of Northern Animals</i>", by Ernest T. Seton
(Charles Scribner's Sons, 2 volumes, $18), contains carefully
written and valuable chapters on fox farming, skunk farming, marten
farming, and mink farming, and other valuable life histories of the
fur-bearing animals of North America.
</p>
<p>
<i> Rod and Gun in Canada</i>, a magazine for sportsmen published by
W.J. Taylor, Woodstock, Ontario, contained in 1912 a series of
articles on "The Culture of Black and Silver Foxes," by R.B. and
L.V. Croft. <i> Country Life in America </i> has published a number
of illustrated articles on fox and skunk farming.
</p>
<p>
With its usual enterprise and forethought, the Biological Survey of
the Department of Agriculture has published a valuable pamphlet of
22 pages on "Silver Fox Farming," by Wilfred H. Osgood, copies of
which can be procured by addressing the Secretary of Agriculture. In
consulting that contribution, however, it must be borne in mind that
just now, in fox farming, history is being made more rapidly than
heretofore.
</p>
<p>
I do not mean to say that the above are the only sources of
information on fur-farming for profit, but they are the ones that
have most impressed me. The files of all the journals and magazines
for sportsmen contain numerous articles on this subject, and they
should be carefully consulted.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Black-Fox Farming. </span> &mdash;The ridiculous prices now being paid in London for the skins of black or "silver" foxes has created in this country a small furore over the breeding of that color-phase of the red fox. The prices that actually have been obtained, both for skins and for live animals for breeding purposes, have a strong tendency to make people crazy. Fancy paying $12,000 in real money for one pair of live black foxes! That has been done, on Prince Edward Island, and $10,000 per pair is now regarded as a bargain-counter figure.
</p>
<p>
On Prince Edward Island, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, black-fox
breeding has been going on for ten years, and is now on a successful
basis. One man has made a fortune in the business, and it is rumored
that a stock company is considering the purchase of his ten-acre fox
ranch at a fabulous figure. The enormous prices obtainable for live
black foxes, male or female, make diamonds and rubies seem cheap and
commonplace; and it is no wonder that enterprising men are tempted
to enter that industry.
</p>
<p>
The price of a black fox is one of the wonders of a recklessly
extravagant and whimsical age. All the fur-wearing world knows very
well <a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page375] </span> </a> that fox fur is one of the poorest of furs
to withstand the wear and tear of actual use. About two seasons'
hard wear are enough to put the best fox skin on the wane, and three
or four can be guaranteed to throw it into the discard. Even the
finest black fox skin is nothing superlatively beautiful! A choice
"cross" fox skin costing only $50 <i> is far more beautiful, as a
color proposition</i>; but London joyously pays $2,500 or $3,000 for
a single black-fox skin, to wear!
</p>
<p>
Of course, all such fads as this are as ephemeral as the butterflies
of summer. The Russo-Japanese war quickly reduced the value of
Alaskan blue foxes from $30 to $18; and away went the Alaskan fox
farms! A similar twist of Fortune's fickle wheel may in any year
send the black fox out of royal favor, and remove the bottom from
the business of producing it. Let us hope, however, that the craze
for that fur will continue; for we like to see our friends and
neighbors make good profits.
</p>
<p class="list">

		CHAPTER XLI
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		TEACHING WILD LIFE PROTECTION TO THE YOUNG
	</div>
</div>
<p>
Thousands of busy and burdened men and women are to-day striving
hard, early and late, to promote measures that will preserve the
valuable wild life of the world. They desire to leave to the boys
and girls of tomorrow a good showing of the marvelous bird and
animal forms that make the world beautiful and interesting. They are
acting on the principle that the wild life of to-day is not ours, to
destroy or to keep as we choose, but has been given to us <i> in
trust</i>, partly for our benefit and partly for those who come
after us and audit our accounts. They believe that we have no right
to squander and destroy a wild-life heritage of priceless value
which we have done nothing to create, and which is not ours to
destroy.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Duty Of Parents. </span> &mdash;This being the case, it is very necessary that the young people of to-day should be taught, early and often, the virtue and the necessity of wild-life protection. There is no reason that the boy of to-day should not take up his share of the common burden, just as soon as he is old enough to wander alone through the woods. Let him be taught in precise terms that he must <i> not rob birds' nests</i>, and that he <i> must not shoot song-birds, woodpeckers and kingfishers </i> with a 22-calibre rifle, or any other gun. At this moment there lies upon my side table a vicious little 22-calibre rifle that was taken from two boys who were camping in the woods of Connecticut, and amusing themselves by shooting valuable insectivorous birds. Now those boys were not wholly to blame for what they were doing; but their fathers and mothers were <i> very much to blame</i>! They should have been taught at the parental knee that it is very wrong to kill any bird except a genuine game bird, and then only in the lawful open season. Those two fathers paid $10 each for having failed in their duty; and it served them right; for they were the real culprits.
</p>
<p>
Small-calibre rifles are becoming alarmingly common in the hands of
boys. <i> Parents must do their duty in the training of their boys
against bird-shooting! </i> It is a very serious matter. A million
boys who roam the fields with small rifles without having been
instructed in protection, can destroy an appalling number of
valuable birds in the course of a year. Some parents are so
slavishly devoted to their children that they wish them to do
everything they please, and be checked in nothing. Such parents
constitute one of the pests of society, and a drag upon the
happiness of their own children! It is now the bounden duty of each
parent to teach each one of his or her children that the time has
come <a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page377] </span> </a> when the resources of nature, and especially
wild life, must be conserved. To permit boys to grow up and acquire
guns without this knowledge is very wrong.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Duty Of Teachers And Schools. </span> &mdash;A great deal of "nature study" is being taught in the public schools of the United States. That the young people of our land should be taught to appreciate the works of nature, and especially animal life and plant life, is very desirable. Thus far, however, there is a screw loose in the system, and that is the shortage in definite, positive instruction regarding <i> individual duty </i> toward the wild creatures, great and small. Along with their nature studies all our school children should be taught, in the imperative mood:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		That it is wrong to disturb breeding birds, or rob birds' nests;
	</li>
	<li>
		That it is wrong to destroy any harmless living creature not properly classed as game, except it be to preserve it in a museum;
	</li>
	<li>
		That it is no longer right for civilized man to look upon wild game as <i> necessary </i> food; because there is plenty of other food, and the remnant of game can not withstand slaughter in that basis;
	</li>
	<li>
		That the time has come when it is the duty of every good citizen to take an active, aggressive part in <i> preventing </i> the destruction of wild life, and in <i> promoting </i> its preservation;
	</li>
	<li>
		That every boy and girl over twelve years of age can do <i> something </i> in this cause, and finally,
	</li>
	<li>
		That protection and encouragement will bring back the almost vanished birds.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
We call upon all boards of education, all principals of schools and
all teachers to educate our boys and girls, constantly and
imperatively, along those lines. Teachers, do not say to your
pupils,&mdash;"It is right and nice to protect birds," but
say:&mdash;"It is your <i> Duty </i> to protect all harmless wild
things, and <i> you must do it</i>!"
</p>
<p>
In a good cause, there is great virtue in "Must."
</p>
<p>
Really, we are losing each year an immense amount of available
wild-life protection. The doctrine of imperative individual duty
never yet has been taught in our schools as it should be taught. A
few teachers have, indeed, covered this ground; but I am convinced
that their proportion is mighty small.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> Text Books. </span> &mdash;The writers of the nature study text books are very much to blame because nine-tenths of the time this subject has been ignored. The situation has not been taken seriously, save in a few cases, by a very few authors. I am glad to report that in 1912 there was published a fine text book by Professor James W. Peabody, of the Morris High School, New York, and Dr. Arthur E. Hunt, in which from beginning to end the duty to protect wild life is strongly insisted upon. It is entitled "Elementary Biology; Plants, Animals and Man."
</p>
<p>
Hereafter, no zoological or nature study text book should be given a
place in any school in America unless the author of it has done his
full share in setting forth the duty of the young citizen toward
wild life. <a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page378] </span> </a> Were I a member of a board of education I
would seek to establish and enforce this requirement. To-day, any
author who will presume to write a text book of nature study or
zoology without knowing and doing his duty toward our vanishing
fauna, is too ignorant of wild life and too careless of his duty
toward it, to be accepted as a safe guide for the young. The time
for criminal indifference has gone by. Hereafter, every one who is
not for the preservation of wild life is against it and it is time
to separate the sheep from the goats.
</p>
<p>
From this time forth, the preservation of our fauna should be
regarded as a subject on which every candidate for a teacher's
certificate should undergo an examination before receiving authority
to teach in a public school. The candidate should be required to
know <i> why </i> the preservation of birds is necessary; why the
slaughter of wild life is wrong and criminal; the extent to which
wild birds and mammals return to us and thrive under protection; why
wild game is no longer a legitimate food supply; why wild game
should not be sold, and why the feathers of wild birds (other than
game birds) never should be used as millinery ornaments.
</p>
<p>
As sensible Americans, and somewhat boastful of our intelligence, we
should put the education of the young in wild-life protection on a
rational business basis.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> State Efforts. </span> &mdash;In several of our states, systematic efforts to educate children in their duty toward wild life are already being made. To this end, an annual "Bird Day" has been established for state-wide observance. This splendid idea is now legally in force in the following states:
</p>
<p>
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Ohio and Wisconsin.
</p>
<p>
Bird Day is also more or less regularly observed, though not legally
provided for, in New York, Indiana, Colorado and Alabama, and
locally in some cities of Pennsylvania. Usually the observance of
the day is combined with that of Arbor Day, and the date is fixed by
proclamation of the Governor.
</p>
<p>
Alabama and Wisconsin regularly issue elaborate and beautiful Arbor
and Bird Day annuals; and Illinois, and possibly other states, have
issued very good publications of this character.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Phillips Educational Campaign For The Birds. </span> &mdash;Quite recently there has come under my notice an episode in the education of school children that has given the public profound satisfaction. I cite it here as an object lesson for pan-America.
</p>
<p>
In Carrick, Pennsylvania, just across the Monongahela River from the
city of Pittsburgh, lives John M. Phillips, State Game Commissioner,
nature-lover, sportsman and friend of man. He is a man who does
things, and gets results. Goat Mountain Park (450 square miles), in
British Columbia, to-day owes its existence to him, for without his
initiative and labor it would not have been established. It was the
first game preserve of British Columbia.
</p>
<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page379] </span> </a>
<p>
Three years ago, Mr. Phillips became deeply impressed by the idea
that one of the best ways in the world to protect the wild life,
both of to-day and the future, would be in teaching school children
to love it and protect it. His fertile brain and open check-book
soon devised a method for his home city. His theory was that by
giving the children <i> something to do</i>, not only in protecting
but in actually <i> bringing back </i> the birds, much might be
accomplished.

	Marching Behind the Governor
</p>
<p>
In studying the subject of bringing back the birds, he found that
the Russian mulberry is one of the finest trees in the world as a
purveyor of good fruit for many kinds of birds. The tree does not
much resemble our native mulberry, but is equally beautiful and
interesting. "The fruit is not a long berry, nor is it of a purple
color, but it grows from buds on the limbs and twigs something after
the manner of the pussy-willow. It is smaller, of light color and
has a very distinct flavor. The most striking peculiarity about the
fruit is that it keeps on ripening during two months or more, new
berries appearing daily while others are ripening. This is why it is
such good bird food. Nor is it half bad for folks, for the berries
are good to look at and to eat, either with cream or without, and to
make pies that will set any sane boy's mouth a-watering at
sight."&mdash;(Erasmus Wilson).
</p>
<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page380] </span> </a>
<p>
Everyone knows the value of sweet cherries, both to birds and to
children.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Phillips decided that he would give away several hundred bird
boxes, and also several hundred sweet cherry and Russian mulberry
trees. The first gift distribution was made in the early spring of
1909. Another followed in 1910, but the last one was the most
notable.
</p>
<p>
On April 11, 1912, Carrick had a great and glorious Bird Day. Mr.
Phillips was the author of it, and Governor Tener the finisher. On
that day occurred the third annual gift distribution of raw
materials designed to promote in the breasts of 2,000 children a
love for birds and an active desire to protect and increase them.
Mr. Phillips gave away 500 bird boxes, 500 sweet cherry trees and
200 mulberry trees. The sun shone brightly, 500 flags waved in
Carrick, the Governor made one of the best speeches of his life, and
Erasmus Wilson, faithful friend of the birds, wrote this good story
of the occasion for the <i> Gazette-Times </i> of Pittsburgh:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
The Governor was there, and the children, the bird-boxes, and the
young trees. And was there ever a brighter or more fitting day for a
children and bird jubilee! The scene was so inspiring that Gov.
Tener made one of the best speeches of his life.
	</p>
	<p>
The distribution of several hundred cherry and mulberry trees was
the occasion, and the beautiful grounds of the Roosevelt school,
Carrick, was the scene.
	</p>
	<p>
Mr. John M. Phillips, sane sportsman and enthusiastic friend of the
birds, has been looking forward to this as the culmination of a
scheme he has been working on for years, and he was more than
pleased with the outcome. The intense delight it afforded him more
than repaid him for all it has cost in all the years past.
	</p>
	<p>
But it was impossible to tell who were the more delighted,&mdash;he,
or the Governor, or the children, or the visitors who were so
fortunate as to be present. County Superintendent of Schools Samuel
Hamilton was simply a mass of delight. And how could he be
otherwise, surrounded as he was by 2,000 and more children fairly
quivering with delight?
	</p>
	<p>
Children will care for and defend things that are their very own,
fight for them and stand guard over them. Realizing this Mr.
Phillips undertook to show them how they could have birds all their
own. Being clever in devising schemes for achieving things most to
be desired, he began giving out bird-boxes to those who would agree
to put them up, and to watch and defend the birds when they came to
make their homes with them. And he found that no more faithful
sentinel ever stood on guard than the boy who had a bird-house all
his own.
	</p>
	<p>
Here was the solution to the vexed problem. Provide boxes for those
who would agree to put them up, care for the birds, and study their
habits and needs. The children agreed at once, and the birds did not
object, so Mr. Phillips had some hundreds, four or five, blue-bird
and wren boxes constructed during the past winter. These were passed
out some weeks ago to any boys or girls who would present an order
signed by their parents, and countersigned by the principal of the
school.
	</p>
	<p>
He knows enough about a boy to know that he does not prize the
things that come without effort, nor will he become deeply
interested in anything for which he is not held more or less
responsible. Hence the advantage in having him write an order, have
it indorsed by his parents, and vouched for by his school principal.
	</p>
	<p>
That he had struck the right scheme was proven by the avidity with
which the girls and boys rushed for the boxes. The fact that a heavy
rain was falling did not dampen their ardor for a moment, nor did
the fact that they were tramping Mr. Phillips' beautiful lawn into a
field of mud.
	</p>
	<p>
Mr. Phillips, seeing the necessity of providing food for the
prospective hosts of birds, and wishing to place the responsibility
on the boys and girls, offered to provide a cherry tree or mulberry
tree for every box erected, provided they should be properly planted
and diligently cared for.
	</p>
	<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page381] </span> </a>
	<p>
This was practically the culmination of the most unique bird scheme
ever attempted, and yesterday was the day set apart for the
distribution of these hundreds of fruit trees, the products of which
are to be divided share and share alike with the birds.
	</p>
	<p>
Nowhere else has such a scheme been attempted, and never before has
there been just such a day of jubilee. The intense interest
manifested by the children, and the earnest enthusiasm manifested,
leaves no doubt about their carrying out their part of the contract.

	DISTRIBUTING BIRD BOXES AND FRUIT TREES
</p>
<p>
Up to date (1912) Mr. Phillips has given away about 1,000 bird
boxes, 1,500 cherry and Russian mulberry trees, and transformed the
schools of Carrick into seething masses of children militantly
enthusiastic in the protection of birds, and in providing them with
homes and food. As a final coup, Mr. Phillips has induced the city
of Pittsburgh to create the office of City Ornithologist, at a
salary of $1200 per year. The duty of the new officer is to protect
all birds in the city from all kinds of molestation, especially when
nesting; to erect bird-houses, provide food for wild birds, on a
large scale, and report annually upon the increase or decrease of
feathered residents and visitors. Mr. Frederic S. Webster, long
known as a naturalist and practical ornithologist, has been
appointed to the position, and is now on active duty.
</p>
<p>
So far as we are aware, Pittsburgh is the first city to create the
office of City Ornithologist. It is a happy thought; it will yield
good results, and other cities will follow Pittsburgh's good
example.

		CHAPTER XLII
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		THE ETHICS OF SPORTSMANSHIP
	</div>
</div>
<p>
I count it as rather strange that American and English sportsmen
have hunted and shot for a century, and until 1908 formulated
practically nothing to establish and define the ethics of shooting
game. Here and there, a few unwritten principles have been evolved,
and have become fixed by common consent; but the total number of
these is very few. Perhaps this has been for the reason that every
free and independent sportsman prefers to be a law unto himself. Is
it not doubly strange, however, that even down to the present year
the term "sportsmen" never has been defined by a sportsman!
</p>
<p>
Forty years ago, a sportsman might have been defined, according to
the standards of that period, as a man who hunts wild game for
pleasure. Those were the days wherein no one foresaw the wholesale
annihilation of species, and there were no wilderness game
preserves. In those days, gentlemen shot female hoofed game, trapped
bears if they felt like it, killed ten times as much big game as
they could use, and no one made any fuss whatever about the waste or
extermination of wild life.
</p>
<p>
Those were the days of ox-teams and broad-axes. To-day, we are
living in a totally different world,&mdash;a world of grinding,
crunching, pulverizing progress, a world of annihilation of the
works of Nature. And what is a sportsman to-day?
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> A Sportsman </span> is a man who loves Nature, and who in the enjoyment of the outdoor life and exploration takes a reasonable toll of Nature's wild animals, but not for commercial profit, and only so long as his hunting does not promote the extermination of species.
</p>
<p>
In view of the disappearance of wild life all over the habitable
globe, and the steady extermination of species, the ethics of
sportsmanship has become a matter of tremendous importance. If a man
can shoot the last living Burchell zebra, or prong-horned antelope,
and be a sportsman and a gentleman, then we may just as well drop
down all bars, and say no more about the ethics of shooting game.
</p>
<p>
But the real gentlemen-sportsmen of the world are not insensible to
the duties of the hour in regard to the taking or not taking of
game. The time has come when canon laws should be laid down, of
world-wide application, and so thoroughly accepted and promulgated
that their binding force can not be ignored. Among other things, it
is time for a list of species to be published which no man claiming
to be either a gentleman or a sportsman can shoot for aught else
than preservation in a public museum. Of course, this list would be
composed of the species <a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"> <span
class="pagenum"> [Page383] </span> </a> that are threatened with
extermination. Of American animals it should include the
prong-horned antelope, Mexican mountain sheep, all the mountain
sheep and goats in the United States, the California grizzly bear,
mule deer, West Indian seal and California elephant seal and walrus.
</p>
<p>
In Africa that list should include the eland, white rhinoceros,
blessbok, bontebok, kudu, giraffes and southern elephants, sable
antelope, rhinoceros south of the Zambesi, leucoryx antelope and
whale-headed stork. In Asia it should include the great Indian
rhinoceros and its allied species, the burrhel, the Nilgiri tahr and
the gayal. The David deer of Manchuria already is extinct in a wild
state.
</p>
<p>
In Australia the interdiction should include the thylacine or
Tasmanian wolf, all the large kangaroos, the emu, lyre bird and the
mallee-bird.
</p>
<p>
Think what it would mean to the species named above if all the
sportsmen of the world would unite in their defense, both actively
and passively! It would be to those species a modus vivendi worth
while.
</p>
<p>
Prior to 1908, no effort (so far as we are aware) ever had been made
to promote the establishment of a comprehensive and up-to-date code
of ethics for sportsmen who shoot. A few clubs of men who are
hunters of big game had expressed in their constitutions a few brief
principles for the purpose of standardizing their own respective
memberships, but that was all. I have not taken pains to make a
general canvass of sportsmen's clubs to ascertain what rules have
been laid down by any large number of organizations.
</p>
<p>
The Boone and Crockett Club, of New York and Washington, had in its
constitution the following excellent article:
</p>
<p>
"Article X. The use of steel traps, the making of large bags, the
killing of game while swimming in water, or helpless in deep snow,
and the unnecessary killing of females or young of any species of
ruminant, shall be deemed offenses. Any member who shall commit such
offenses may be suspended, or expelled from the Club by unanimous
vote of the Executive Committee."
</p>
<p>
In 1906, this Club condemned the use of automatic shotguns in
hunting as unsportsmanlike.
</p>
<p>
The Lewis and Clark Club, of Pittsburgh, has in its constitution, as
Section 3 of Article 3, the following comprehensive principle:
</p>
<p>
"The term 'legitimate sport' means not only the observance of local
laws, but excludes all methods of taking game other than by fair
stalking or still hunting."
</p>
<p>
At the end of the constitution of this club is this declaration, and
admonition:
</p>
<p>
"<i>Purchase and sale of Trophies</i>.&mdash;As the purchase of
heads and horns establishes a market value, and encourages Indians
and others to "shoot for sale," often in violation of local laws and
always to the detriment of the protection of game for legitimate
sport, the Lewis and Clark Club condemns the purchase or the sale of
the heads or horns of any game."
</p>
<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page384] </span> </a>
<p>
In 1906 the Lewis and Clark Club condemned the use of automatic
shotguns as unsportsmanlike.
</p>
<p>
The Shikar Club, of London, a club which contains all the big-game
hunters of the nobility and gentry of England, <a name="FNanchorQ"
id="FNanchorQ"> </a> <a class="footnote-marker" href="#Footnote_Q">
[Q] </a> and of which His Majesty King George is Honorary President,
has declared the leading feature of its "Objects" in the following
terms:
</p>
<p>
"To maintain the standard of sportsmanship. It is not squandered
bullets and swollen bags which appeal to us. The test is rather in a
love of forest, mountains and desert; in acquired knowledge of the
habits of animals; in the strenuous pursuit of a wary and dangerous
quarry; in the instinct for a well-devised approach to a fair
shooting distance; and in the patient retrieve of a wounded animal."
</p>
<p>
In 1908 the Camp-Fire Club of America formally adopted, as its code
of ethics, the "Sportsman's Platform" of fifteen articles that was
prepared by the writer and placed before the sportsmen of America,
Great Britain and her colonial dependencies in that year. In the
book of the Club it regularly appears as follows:
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<blockquote>
	<p class="centerheading">
		CODE OF ETHICS
		<br />
		OF THE
		<br />
		CAMP-FIRE CLUB OF AMERICA
	</p>
	<p class="centerflat">
		<i> Proposed by Wm. T. Hornaday and adopted December 10, 1908 </i>
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			The wild animal life of to-day is not ours, to do with as we please. The original stock is given to us <i> in trust</i>, for the benefit both of the present and the future. We must render an accounting of this trust to those who come after us.
		</li>
		<li>
			Judging from the rate at which the wild creatures of North America are now being destroyed, fifty years hence there will be no large game left in the United States nor in Canada, outside of rigidly protected game preserves. It is therefore the duty of every good citizen to promote the protection of forests and wild life and the creation of game preserves, while a supply of game remains. Every man who finds pleasure in hunting or fishing should be willing to spend both time and money in active work for the protection of forests, fish and game.
		</li>
		<li>
			The sale of game is incompatible with the perpetual preservation of a proper stock of game; therefore it should be prohibited by laws and by public sentiment.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the settled and civilized regions of North America there is no real <i> necessity </i> for the consumption of wild game as human food: nor is there any good excuse for the sale of game for food purposes. The maintenance of hired laborers on wild game should be prohibited everywhere, under severe penalties.
		</li>
		<li>
			An Indian has no more right to kill wild game, or to subsist upon it all the year round, than any white man in the same locality. The Indian has no inherent or God-given ownership of the game of North America, anymore than of its mineral resources; and he should be governed by the same game laws as white men.
		</li>
		<li>
			No man can be a good citizen and also be a slaughterer of game or fishes beyond the narrow limits compatible with high-class sportsmanship. <a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page385]</span> </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			A game-butcher or a market-hunter is an undesirable citizen, and should be treated as such.
		</li>
		<li>
			The highest purpose which the killing of wild game and game fishes can hereafter be made to serve is in furnishing objects to overworked men for tramping and camping trips in the wilds; and the value of wild game as human food should no longer be regarded as an important factor in its pursuit.
		</li>
		<li>
			If rightly conserved, wild game constitutes a valuable asset to any country which possesses it; and it is good statesmanship to protect it.
		</li>
		<li>
			An ideal hunting trip consists of a good comrade, fine country, and a <i> very few </i> trophies per hunter.
		</li>
		<li>
			In an ideal hunting trip, the death of the game is only an incident; and by no means is it really necessary to a successful outing.
		</li>
		<li>
			The best hunter is the man who finds the most game, kills the least, and leaves behind him no wounded animals.
		</li>
		<li>
			The killing of an animal means the end of its most interesting period. When the country is fine, pursuit is more interesting than possession.
		</li>
		<li>
			The killing of a female hoofed animal, save for special preservation, is to be regarded as incompatible with the highest sportsmanship; and it should everywhere be prohibited by stringent laws.
		</li>
		<li>
			A particularly fine photograph of a large wild animal in its haunts is entitled to more credit than the dead trophy of a similar animal. An animal that has been photographed never should be killed, unless previously wounded in the chase.
		</li>

<hr class="subchapter" />
<p>
This platform has been adopted as a code of ethics by the following
organizations, besides the Camp-Fire Club of America:
</p>
<p>
The Lewis and Clark Club, of Pittsburgh, John M. Phillips,
President.
</p>
<p>
The North American Fish and Game Protective Association
(International)
</p>
<p>
Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Association, Boston.
</p>
<p>
Camp-Fire Club of Michigan, Detroit.
</p>
<p>
Rod and Gun Club, Sheridan County, Wyoming.
</p>
<p>
The platform has been endorsed and published by The Society for the
Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the British Empire (London), which
is an endorsement of far-reaching importance.
</p>
<p>
Major J. Stevenson-Hamilton, C.M.Z.S., Warden of the Government Game
Reserves of the Transvaal, South Africa, has adopted the platform
and given it the most effective endorsement that it has received
from any single individual. In his great work on game protection in
Africa and wild-animal lore, entitled "Animal Life in Africa" (and
"very highly commended" by the Committee on Literary Honors of the
Camp-Fire Club), he publishes the entire platform, with a depth and
cordiality of endorsement that is bound to warm the heart of every
man who believes in the principles laid down in that document. He
says, "It should be printed on the back of every license that is
issued for hunting in Africa."
</p>
<p>
I am profoundly impressed by the fact that it is high time for
sportsmen all over the world to take to heart the vital necessity of
adopting high and clearly defined codes of ethics, to suit the needs
of the present hour. The days of game abundance, and the careless
treatment of wild life have gone by, never to return.

		CHAPTER XLIII
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		THE DUTY OF AMERICAN ZOOLOGISTS AND EDUCATORS TO AMERICAN WILD LIFE
	</div>
</div>
<p>
The publication of this chapter will hardly be regarded as a bid for
fame, or even popularity, on the part of the author. However, the
subject can not be ignored simply because it is disagreeable.
</p>
<p>
Throughout sixty years, to go no further back, the people of America
have been witnessing the strange spectacle of American zoologists,
as a mass, so intent upon the academic study of our continental
fauna that they seem not to have cared a continental about the
destruction of that fauna.
</p>
<p>
During that tragic period twelve species of North American birds
have been totally exterminated, twenty-three are almost
exterminated, and the mammals have fared very badly.
</p>
<p>
If "by their works ye shall know them," then no man can say that the
men referred to have been conspicuous on the firing line in defense
of assaulted wild life. In their hearts, we know that in an academic
way the naturalists of America do care about wild-life slaughter,
and the extermination of species; and we also know that perhaps
fifty American zoologists have at times taken an active and serious
interest in protection work.
</p>
<p>
I am speaking now of the general body of museum directors and
curators; professors and teachers of zoology in our institutions of
learning&mdash;a legion in themselves; teachers of nature study in
our secondary schools; investigators and specialists in state and
government service; the taxidermists and osteologists; and the array
of literary people who, like all the foregoing, <i> make their bread
and butter out of the exploitation of wild life</i>.
</p>
<p>
Taken as a whole, the people named above constitute a grand army of
at least five thousand trained, educated, resourceful and
influential persons. They all <i> depend upon wild life for their
livelihood</i>. When they talk about living things, the public
listens with respectful attention. Their knowledge of the value of
wild life would be worth something to our cause; but thus far it
never has been capitalized!
</p>
<p>
These people are hard workers; and when they mark out definite
courses and attainable goals, they know how to get results. Yet what
do we see?
</p>
<p>
For sixty long years, with the exception of the work of a corporal's
guard of their number, this grand army has remained in camp, partly
<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page387]
</span> </a> neglecting and partly refusing to move upon the works
of the enemy. For sixty years, with the exception of the
non-game-bird law, as a class and a mass they have left to the
sportsmen of the country the dictating of laws for the protection of
all the game birds, the mammals and the game fishes. When we stop to
consider that the game birds alone embrace <i> 154 very important
species</i>, the appalling extent to which the zoologist has
abdicated in favor of the sportsman becomes apparent.
</p>
<p>
It is a very great mistake, and a wrong besides, for the zoologists
of the country to abandon the game birds, mammals and fishes of
North America to the sportsmen, to do with as they please! Yet that
is practically what has been done.
</p>
<p>
The time was, thirty or forty years ago, when wild life was so
abundant that we did not need to worry about its preservation. That
was the golden era of study and investigation. That era ended
definitely in 1884, with the practical extermination of the wild
American bison, partly through the shameful greed and partly through
the neglect of the American people. We are now living <i> in the
middle of the period of Extermination! </i> The questions for every
American zoologist and every sportsman to answer now are: Shall the
slaughter of species go on to a quick end of the period? Shall we
give posterity a birdless, gameless, fishless continent, or not?
Shall we have close seasons, all over the country, for five or ten
years, or for five hundred years?
</p>
<p>
If we are courageous, we will brace up and answer these questions
now, like men. If we are faint-hearted, and eager for peace at any
price, then we will sidestep the ugly situation until the destroyers
have settled it for us by the wholesale extermination of species.
</p>
<p>
If the zoologist cares to know, then I will tell him that to-day the
wild life of the world <i> can </i> be saved by law, but <i> not by
sentiment alone! </i> You cannot "educate" a poacher, a game-hog, a
market-gunner, a milliner or a vain and foolish woman of fashion.
All these must be curbed and controlled <i> by law</i>. Game refuges
alone will not save the wild life! <i> All </i> species of birds,
mammals and game fishes of North America must have more thorough and
far-reaching protection than they now have.
</p>
<p>
Do not always take your cue from the sportsmen, especially regarding
the enactment of long close seasons! If you need good advice, or
help about drafting a bill, write to Dr. T.S. Palmer, Department of
Agriculture, Washington, and you will receive prompt and valuable
assistance. The Doctor is a wise man, and there is nothing about
protective laws that is unknown to him. Go to <i> your </i> state
senator and <i> your </i> assemblyman with the bills that you know
should be enacted into law, and assure them that those measures are
necessary for the wild life, and beneficial to 98 per cent of the
people <i> who own the wild life</i>. You will be heard with
respectful attention, in any law-making body that you choose to
enter.
</p>
<p>
People who cannot give time and labor must supply you with money for
your campaigns. <i> Ask</i>, and you will receive! I have proven
this many <a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page388] </span> </a> times. With care and exactness account to
your subscribers for the expenditure of all money placed in your
hands, and you will receive continuous support.
</p>
<p>
In times of great stress, print circulars and leaflets by the
ten-thousand, and get them into the hands of the People, calling for
<i> their </i> help. Our 42,000 copies of the "Wild Life Call"
(sixteen pages) were distributed by organizations all over the state
of New York, and along with Mr. Andrew D. Meloy's letters to the
members of the New York State League, aroused such a tidal wave of
public sentiment against the sale of game that the Bayne bill was
finally swept through the Legislature with only one dissenting vote!
And yet, in the beginning not one man dared to hope that that very
revolutionary measure could by any possibility be passed in its
first year in New York State, even if it ever could be!
</p>
<p>
It was the aroused Public that did it!
</p>
<p>
This volume has been written (under great pressure) in order to put
the whole situation before the people of America, including the
zoologists, and to give them some definite information, state by
state, regarding the needs of the hour. Look at the needs of your
own state, in the "Roll Call of States," and you will find work for
your hand to do. Clear your conscience by taking hold now, to do
everything that you can to stop the carnage and preserve the
remnant. Twenty-five or fifty years hence, if we have a birdless and
gameless continent, let it not be said that the zoologists of
America helped to bring it about by wicked apathy.
</p>
<p>
At this juncture, a brief survey of the attitude toward wild life of
certain American institutions of national reputation will be
decidedly pertinent. I shall mention only a few of the many that
through their character and position owe specific duties to this
cause. <i> Noblesse oblige</i>!
</p>
<p>
The Biological Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is a
splendid center of activity and initiative in the preservation of
our wild life. The work of Dr. T.S. Palmer has already been spoken
of, and thanks to his efforts and direction, the Survey has become
the recognized special champion of preservation in America.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. Forestry Bureau is developing into a very valuable ally,
and we confidently look forward to the time when its influence in
preservation will be a hundred times more potent than it is to-day.
<i> That will be when every national forest is made a game preserve,
and every forest ranger is made a game warden</i>. Let us have both
those developments, and quickly.
</p>
<p>
In 1896 the <span class="list"> <span class="title"> American Museum
Of Natural History </span> </span> became a center of activity in
bird protection, and the headquarters of the New York State Audubon
Society. The president of the Museum (Professor Henry Fairfield
Osborn) is also the president of that organization.
</p>
<p>
In several of the New York State movements for bird conservation,
especially those bearing on the plumage law, the American Museum has
been active, and at times conspicuous. No one (so I believe) ever
appealed to the President of the Museum for help on the firing line
without receiving help of some kind. Unfortunately, however, the <a
name="Page_389" id="Page_389"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page389]
</span> </a> preservation of wild life is not one of the declared
objects of the American Museum corporation, or one on which its
officers may spend money, as is so freely and even joyously done by
the Zoological Society. The Museum's influence has been exerted
chiefly through the active workers of the State Audubon Society, and
it was as president of that body that Professor Osborn subscribed to
the fund that was so largely instrumental in creating the New York
law against the sale of game.
</p>
<p>
There is room for an important improvement in the declared objects
of the American Museum. To the cause of protection it is a distinct
loss that that great and powerful institution should be unable to
spend any money in promoting the preservation of our fauna from
annihilation. An amendment to its constitution is earnestly
recommended.
</p>
<p>
The activities of the <span class="list"> <span class="title"> New
York Zoological Society </span> </span> began in 1896, and they do
not require comment here. They have been continuous, aggressive and
far-reaching, and they have been supported by thousands of dollars
from the Society's treasury. It is true that the funds available for
protection work have not represented a great annual sum, such as the
work demands, but the amount being expended from year to year is
steadily increasing. In serious emergencies there is <i> always
something available</i>! During the past two years, to relieve the
Society of a portion of this particular burden, the director of the
Park secured several large subscriptions from persons outside the
Society, who previously had never entered into this work.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="list"> <span class="title"> Milwaukee Public Museum
</span> </span> has entered actively and effectively into the fight
to preserve the birds of Wisconsin from annihilation by the
saloon-loafer element that three years ago determined to repeal the
best bird laws on the books, and throw the shooting privilege wide
open. Mr. Henry L. Ward, Director of the Museum, went to the firing
line, and remained there. Last year the saloon element thought that
they had a large majority of the votes in the legislature pledged to
vote their way. It looked like it; but when the decent people again
rose and demanded justice for the birds, the members of the
legislature stood by them in large majorities. The spring-shooting,
bag-limit and hunting-license laws were <i> not </i> repealed.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The University Of Kansas </span> (Lawrence) scored heavily for the cause of wild-life protection when in 1908 it gave to the Governor of the state the services of a member of its faculty, Professor Lewis Lindsay Dyche, who was wanted to fill the position of State Fish and Game Commissioner. Professor Dyche proved to be a very live wire, and his activities have covered the State of Kansas to its farthest corners. We love him for the host of enemies he has made&mdash;among the poachers, game-butchers, pseudo-"sportsmen" and lawbreakers generally. The men who thought they had the "pull" of friendship for lawbreaking were first warned, and then as second offenders hauled up to the bar, one and all. The more the destroyers try to hound the Commissioner, the more popular is he with the great, solid mass of good citizens who believe in the saving of wild life.
</p>
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page390] </span> </a>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Museum Of Comparative Zoology </span> has at last made a beginning in the field of protection. Last winter, while the great battle raged over the Wharton no-sale-of-game bill, several members of the Museum staff appeared at the hearings and otherwise worked for the success of the measure. It was most timely aid,&mdash;and very much needed. It is to be hoped that that auspicious beginning will be continued from year to year. The Museum should keep at least one good fighter constantly in the field.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Boston Society Of Natural History </span> takes a very active part in promoting the preservation of the fauna of Massachusetts, and in resisting the attempts of the destroyers to repeal the excellent laws now in force. Its members put forth vigorous efforts in the great campaign of 1912.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Brooklyn Institute Of Arts And Sciences </span> is well represented in the field of protection by Director Franklin W. Hooper, now president of the American Bison Society, and an earnest promoter of the perpetuation of the bison. When, the Wind Cave National Bison Herd is fully established, in South Dakota, as it practically <i> is already</i>, the chief credit for that coup will be due to the unflagging energy and persistence of Professor Hooper.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The Buffalo Academy Of Sciences </span> in 1911 entered actively and effectively, under the leadership of Dr. Lee H. Smith, into the campaign for the Bayne bill. Besides splendid service rendered in western New York, Dr. Smith appeared in Albany with a strong delegation in support of the bill.
</p>
<p class="list">
	<span class="title"> The University Of California </span> was the first institution of learning to enter the field of wild-life protection for active, aggressive and permanent work. W.L. Taylor and Joseph Grinnell, of the University Museum, have taken up the fight to save the fauna of California from the dangers that now threaten it.
</p>
<p>
At this point our enumeration of the activities of American
zoological institutions comes to an unfortunate end. There are many
individuals to be named elsewhere, in the roll of honor, but that is
another story. I am now going to set before the public the names of
certain institutions largely devoted to zoology and permeated by
zoologists, which thus far seem to have entirely ignored the needs
of our fauna, and which so far we know have contributed neither men,
money nor encouragement to the Army of the Defense.
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p class="centerheading">
	Partial List Of Institutions Owing Service To Wild Life.
</p>
<p>
<i> The United States National Museum </i> contains a large and
expensive corps of zoological curators and assistant curators, some
of whom long ago should have taken upon themselves the task of
reforming the laws of the District of Columbia, Virginia and
Maryland, at their very doors! This museum should maintain at least
one man in the field of protection, and the existence of the
Biological Survey is no excuse for the Museum's inactivity.
</p>
<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page391] </span> </a>
<p>
<i> The Field Museum </i> of Chicago is a great institution, but it
appears to be inactive in wild-life protection, and indifferent to
the fate of our wild life. Its influence is greatly needed on the
firing line, especially in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and northern
Minnesota. First of all the odious sale-of-game situation in Chicago
should be cleaned up!
</p>
<p>
<i> The Philadelphia Academy of Sciences </i> has been represented
on the A.O.U. Committee on Bird Protection by Mr. Witmer Stone. The
time has come when this Academy should be represented on the firing
line as a virile, wide-awake, self-sacrificing and aggressive force.
It is perhaps the oldest zoological body in the United States! Its
scientific standing is unquestioned. Its members <i> must </i> know
of the carnage that is going on around them, for they are not
ignorant men. The Pennsylvania State Game Commission to-day stands
in urgent need of active, vigorous and persistent assistance from
the Philadelphia Academy in the fierce campaign already in progress
for additional protective laws. Will that help be given?
</p>
<p>
<i> The Carnegie Institute </i> of Washington (endowment
$22,000,000) unquestionably owes a great duty toward wild life, no
portion of which has yet been discharged. Academic research work is
all very well, but it does not save faunas from annihilation. In the
saving of the birds and mammals of North America a hundred million
people are directly interested, and the cause is starving for money,
men and publicity. Education is not the ONLY duty of educators!
</p>
<p>
<i> The Carnegie Museum </i> at Pittsburgh should be provided by
Pittsburgh with sufficient funds that its Director can put a good
man into the field of protection, and maintain his activities. The
State of Pennsylvania, and the nation at large, needs such a worker
at Pittsburgh; and this statement is not open to argument!

	A Few Of The Institutions Of Learning Which Should Each Devote One Man To This Cause.
</p>
<p>
<i> Columbia University</i>, of New York, has a very large and
strong corps of zoological professors in its Department of Biology.
No living organism is too small or too worthless to be studied by
high-grade men; but does any man of Columbia ever raise his voice,
actively and determinedly, for the preservation of our fauna, or any
other fauna? Columbia should give the services of one man wholly to
this cause.
</p>
<p>
There are men whose zoological ideals soar so high that they can not
see <a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page392] </span> </a> the slaughter of wild creatures that is so
furiously proceeding on the surface of this blood-stained earth. We
don't want to hear about the "behavior" of protozoans while our best
song birds are being exterminated by negroes and poor whites.
</p>
<p>
<i> Cornell University </i> should now awaken to the new situation.
All the zoological Neros should not fiddle while Rome burns. For the
sake of consistency, Cornell should devote the services of at least
one member of its large and able faculty to the cause of wild-life
protection. Cornell was a pioneer in forestry teaching; and why
should she not lead off now in the new field?
</p>
<p>
<i> Yale University</i>, in Professor James W. Toumey, Director of
the School of Forestry, possesses a natural, ready-made protector of
wild life. From forestry to wild life is an easy step. We hopefully
look forward to the development of Professor Toumey into a militant
protectionist, fighting for the helpless creatures that <i> must
</i> be protected by man <i> or perish</i>! If Yale is willing to
set a new pace for the world's great universities, she has the Man
ready at hand.
</p>
<p>
<i> The University of Chicago </i> should become the center of a
great new protectionist movement which should cover the whole Middle
West area, from the plains to Pittsburgh. This is the inflexible,
logical necessity of the hour. <i> Either protect zoology, or else
for very shame give up teaching it</i>!
</p>
<p>
<i> Every higher institution of learning in America now has a duty
in this matter</i>. Times have changed. Things are not as they were
thirty years ago. To allow a great and valuable wild fauna to be
destroyed and wasted is a crime, against both the present and the
future. If we mean to be good citizens we cannot shirk the duty to
conserve. We are trustees of the inheritance of future generations,
and we have no right to squander that inheritance. If we fail of our
plain duty, the scorn of future generations surely will be our
portion.

		CHAPTER XLIV
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">
		THE GREATEST NEEDS OF THE WILD-LIFE CAUSE AND THE DUTY OF THE HOUR
	</div>
</div>
<p>
The fate of wild life in North America hangs to-day by three very
slender threads, the names of which you will hardly guess unaided.
They are Labor, Money and Publicity! The threads are slender because
there is so little raw material in them.
</p>
<p>
We do not need money with which to "buy votes" or "influence," but
money with which to pay workers; to publish things to arouse the
American people; to sting sportsmen into action; to hire wardens; to
prosecute game-hogs and buy refuges for wild life. If a sufficient
amount of money for these purposes cannot be procured, then as sure
as the earth continues to revolve, our wild life will pass away,
forever.
</p>
<p>
This is no cause for surprise, or wonder. In this twentieth century
money is essential to every great enterprise, whether it be for
virtue or mischief. The enemies of wild life, and the people who
support them, are very powerful. The man whose pocket or whose
personal privilege is threatened by new legislation is prompted by
business reasons to work against you, and spend money in protecting
his interests.
</p>
<p>
Now, it happens that the men of ordinary means who have nothing
personal at stake in the preservation of wild life save sentimental
considerations, cannot afford to leave their business more than
three or four days each year on protection affairs. Yet many times
services are demanded for many days, or even weeks together, in
order to accomplish results. Bad repeal bills must be fought until
they are dead; and good protective bills must be supported until the
breath of life is breathed into them by the executive signature.
</p>
<p>
With money in hand, good men aways can be found who will work in
game protection for about one-half what they would demand in other
pursuits. With the men <i> whom, you really desire</i>, sentiment is
always a controlling factor. It is my inflexible rule, however, in
asking for services, that men who give valuable time and strength to
the cause shall not be allowed to take their expense money from
their own pockets. Soldiers on the firing line <i> cannot </i>
provide the sinews of war that come from the paymaster's chest!
</p>
<p>
Campaigns of publicity are matters of tremendous necessity and
importance; but their successful promotion requires hundreds, or
possibly thousands of dollars, for each state that is covered.
</p>
<p>
I believe that the wealthy men and women of America are the most
liberal <a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"> <span class="pagenum">
[Page394] </span> </a> givers for the benefit of humanity that can
be found in all the world. New York especially contains a great
number of men who year in and year out work hard for money&mdash;in
order to give it away! The depth and breadth of the philanthropic
spirit in New York City is to me the most surprising of all the
strange impulses that sway the inhabitants of that seething mass of
mixed humanity. Every imaginable cause for the benefit of
mankind,&mdash;save one,&mdash;has received, and still is receiving,
millions of gift dollars.
</p>
<p>
Some enterprises for the transcendant education of the people are at
this moment hopelessly wallowing in the excess of wealth that has
been thrust upon them. Men are being hired at high salaries to help
spend wealth in high, higher, highest education and research. It is
now fashionable to bequeath millions to certain causes that do not
need them in the least! In education there is a mad scramble to
educate every young man to the topmost notch, often far above his
probable station in life, and into tastes and wants far beyond his
powers to maintain.
</p>
<p>
In all this, however, there would be no cause for regret if the wild
life of our continent were not in such a grievous state. If we felt
no conscience burden for those who come after us, we would not care
where the millions go; but since things are as they are, it is
heartbreaking to see the cause of wild-life protection actually
starving, or at the best subsisting only on financial husks and
crumbs, while less important causes literally flounder in surplus
wealth.
</p>
<p>
This regret is intensified by the knowledge that <i> in no other
cause for the conservation of the resources most valuable to mankind
will a dollar go so far, or bring back such good results, as in the
preservation of wild life! </i> The promotion of "the Bayne bill"
and the enactment of the Bayne law is a fair example. That law is
to-day on the statute books of the State of New York because fifty
men and women promptly subscribed $5,000 to a fund formed with
special reference to the expenses of the campaign for that measure;
and the uplift of that victory will be felt for years to come, just
as it already has been in Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
At one time I was tempted to show the financial skeleton in the
closet of wild-life protection, by inserting here a statement of the
funds available to be expended by all the New York organizations
during the campaign year of 1911-1912. But I cannot do it. The
showing is too painful, too humiliating. From it our enemies would
derive too much comfort.
</p>
<p>
Even in New York State, in view of the great interests at stake, the
showing is pitiful. But what shall we say of Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, and a dozen other states
where the situation is much worse? In the winter of 1912 a cry for
help came to us from a neighboring state, where a terrific fight was
being made by the forces of destruction against all reform measures,
and in behalf of retrogression on spring shooting. The appeal said:
"The situation in our legislature is the worst that it has been in
years. Our enemies are very strong, well organized, and they fight
us at every step. We have <i> no funds</i>, and we are expected to
make bricks without straw! Is there not <i> something </i> that you
can do to help us?"
</p>
<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page395] </span> </a>
<p>
There was!
</p>
<p>
Only one week previously, a good friend (who declines to be named)
gave us <i> two thousand dollars</i>, of real money, for just such
emergencies.
</p>
<p>
Within thirty-six hours an entirely new fighting force had been
organized and equipped for service. Within one week, those
reinforcements had made a profound impression on the defenses of the
enemy, and in the end the great fight was won. Of our small campaign
fund it took away over one thousand dollars; but the victory was
worth it.
</p>
<p>
With money enough,&mdash;a reasonable sum,&mdash;the birds of North
America, and some of the small-mammal species also, can be saved.
The big game that is hunted and killed outside the game preserves,
and outside of such places as New Brunswick and the Adirondacks, can
<i> not </i> be saved&mdash;until <i> each species </i> is given
perpetual protection. Colorado is saving a small remnant of her
mountain sheep, but Montana and Wyoming are wasting theirs, because
they allow killing, and the killers are ten times too numerous for
the sheep. They imagine that by permitting only the killing of rams
they are saving the species; but that is an absolute fallacy, and
soon it will have a fatal ending.
</p>
<p>
With an endowment fund of $2,000,000 (only double the price of the
two old Velasquez paintings purchased recently by a gentleman of New
York!) a very good remnant of the wild life of North America could
be saved.
</p>
<p>
But who will give the fund, or even a quarter of it?
</p>
<p>
Thus far, the largest sums ever given in America for the cause of
wild-life protection, so far as I know personally, have been the
following:

<p>
Of all the above, the only endowment funds yielding an annual income
are those of the National Association of Audubon Societies and the
Caroline Phelps Stokes fund of $5,000 in the treasury of the
Zoological Society.
</p>
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page396] </span> </a>
<p>
A fund of $25,000 per year for five years has been guaranteed by the
makers of shot-guns, rifles and ammunition, to the American Game
Protective and Propagation Association. This is like a limited
endowment.
</p>
<p>
In the civilized world there are citizens of many kinds; but all of
them can be placed in two groups: (1) those with a sense of duty
toward mankind, and who will do their duty as good citizens; and (2)
those who from the cradle to the grave meanly and sordidly study
their own selfish interests, who never do aught save in expectation
of a quick return benefit, and who recognize no such thing as duty
toward mankind at large.
</p>
<p>
Men and women of the first class are honored in life, mourned when
dead, and gratefully remembered by posterity. They leave the world
better than they found it, and their lives have been successful.
</p>
<p>
Men and women of the second class are merely so many pieces of
animated furniture; and when they pass out the world cares no more
than when old chairs are thrown upon the scrap-heap.
</p>
<p>
There are many men so selfish, so ignorant and mean of soul that
even out of well-filled purses they would not give ten dollars to
save the whole bird fauna of North America from annihilation. To all
persons of that brand, it is useless to appeal. As soon as you find
one, waste no time upon him. Get out of his neighborhood as quickly
as you can, and look for help among real MEN.
</p>
<p>
The wild life of the world cannot be saved by a few persons, even
though they work their hearts out in the effort. The cause needs two
million more helpers; and they must be sought in Group No. 1. They
are living, somewhere; but the great trouble is to find them, <i>
before it is too late</i>.
</p>
<p>
There are times and causes in which the good citizen has no option
but to render service. The most important of such causes are: the
relief of suffering humanity, the conservation of the resources of
nature, and the prevention of vandalism. If the American Nation had
refused aid to stricken San Francisco, the callous hard-heartedness
of it would have shocked the world. If the German army of 1871 had
destroyed the art treasures and the libraries of Paris, it would
have set the German nation back ten centuries, into the ranks of the
lowest barbarians.
</p>
<p>
And yet, in America, and in the regions now being scourged by the
feather trade, a wonderful FAUNA is being destroyed! It took <i>
millions of years </i> to develop that marvelous array of wild life;
and when gone <i> it never can be replaced</i>! Yet the Army of
Destruction is sweeping it away as joyously as a hired laborer cuts
down a field of corn.
</p>
<p>
That wild life <i> can </i> be saved! If done, it must be done by
the men and women of Group No. 1. The means by which it can be saved
are: <i> Money, labor </i> and <i> publicity. Every man of </i>
ordinary means and intelligence can contribute either money or
labor. The men on the firing line must not be expected to furnish
their own food and ammunition. The Workers MUST be provided with the
money that active campaign work imperatively demands! <a
name="Page_397" id="Page_397"> <span class="pagenum"> [Page397]
</span> </a> Those who cannot conveniently or successfully labor
should give money to this cause; but at the same time, every good
citizen should keep in touch with his lawmaking representatives, and
in times of need ask for votes for whatever new laws are necessary.
</p>
<p>
With money enough to arouse the American people in certain ways, the
wild life of North America (north of Mexico) can be saved. <i> Money
</i> can secure labor and publicity, and the People will do the
rest. For this campaign work I want, <i> and must have</i>, a
permanent fund of $10,000 per annum,&mdash;cash always ready for
every emergency in field work. I greatly need, <i> and must have,
immediately</i>, an endowment Wild-Life Fund of at least $100,000,
and eventually $250,000. I can no longer "pass the hat" each year.
This is needed in addition to the several thousands of dollars
annually being expended by the Zoological Society in this work. The
Society is already doing its utmost in wild-life protection, just as
it is in several other fields of activity.
</p>
<p>
Outside of New York many wealthy men will say, "Let New York do it!"
That often is the way when national campaigning is to be done. In
<i> national </i> wild-life protection work, New York is to-day
bearing about nine-tenths of the burden. It is my belief that in
1912 outside of New York City less than $10,000 was raised and
expended in wild-life protection save by state and national
appropriations. We know that in the year mentioned New York expended
$221,000 in this cause, all from private sources.
</p>
<p>
In a very short time I shall call for the $100,000 that I now must
have as an endowment fund for nation-wide work, to be placed at
5-1/2 per cent interest for the $5,500 annual income that it will
yield. How much of this will come from outside the State of New
York? Some of it, I am sure, will come from Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania; but will any of it come from Cleveland, Cincinnati,
Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco?
</p>
<hr class="subchapter" />
<p class="centerheading">
	The Duty Of The Hour
</p>
<p>
I have now said my say in behalf of wild life. Surely the path of
duty toward the remnant of wild life is plain enough. Will those who
read this book pass along my message that the hour for a revolution
has struck? Will the millions of men commanded by General Apathy now
arouse, before it is too late to act?
</p>
<p>
Will the true sportsmen rise up, and do their duty, bravely and
unselfishly?
</p>
<p>
Will the people with wealth to give away do their duty toward wild
life and humanity, fairly and generously?
</p>
<p>
Will the zoologists awake, leave their tables in their stone palaces
of peace, and come out to the firing-line?
</p>
<p>
Will the lawmakers heed the handwriting on the wall, and make laws
that represent the full discharge of their duty toward wild life and
humanity?
</p>
<p>
Will the editors beat the alarm-gong, early and late, in season and
out of season, until the people awake?
</p>
<p>
On the answers to these questions hang the fate of the wild
creatures of the world,&mdash;their preservation or their
extermination.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
